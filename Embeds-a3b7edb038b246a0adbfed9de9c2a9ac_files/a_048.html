are great';\n\nconst updatedStr = str.replace(/example/g, 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and snippets are greatr'\n\nbut now we have new friend in town, replaceAll\n\nconst str = 'this is

[What We Consider a Web Development Tool](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#what-we-consider-a-web-development-tool)\n2.  [How Web Development Tools Can Streamline Your Workflow](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#how-web-development-tools-can-streamline-your-workflow)\n3.  [How to Choose the Right Development Stack For Your Project](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#how-to-choose-the-right-development-stack-for-your-project)\n4.  [60 Awesome Web Development Tools to Use in 2021](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#60-awesome-web-development-tools-to-use-in-2021)\n\nOn the surface, categorizing a web development tool seems simple. However, even diving into the shallow end presents a few considerations that blur the lines.\n\nFor example, consider whether a video streaming service counts as a development tool. In a bubble, probably not. However, if you’re using it to record your screen for a specific design application, it suddenly transforms into a unique collaborative tool.\n\nIn our opinion, a web development tool is something that helps you achieve your project’s aims in a focused way. While this doesn’t include individual programming languages, there *are* subsets, supersets, and frameworks [such as TypeScript](https://kinsta.com/blog/scripting-languages/) that straddle the line. If you want to [earn the big bucks](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/#what-do-you-need-to-become-a-web-developer), keeping tabs on these aspects is vital.\n\nFor another example, [consider Git](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/). You could argue that this Version Control System (VCS) covers a lot of ground. There’s a specific language used to run commands, and the core functionality offers a great deal in terms of web development. However, you’re also able to use it as a learning tool, specifically by trawling issue tracking logs and commits.\n\nOverall, a web development tool could be practically anything that makes your project run efficiently and productively. You’ll notice this diversity in the list of the tools.\n\n[There’s something incredibly exciting about opening TextEdit or Notepad and typing “\u003cHTML\u003e” to kick off a new project 🤓 These 60 helpful web development tools will help you organize and optimize your experience ✅Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinsta.com%2Fblog%2Fweb-development-tools%2F\u0026via=kinsta\u0026text=There%E2%80%99s+something+incredibly+exciting+about+opening+TextEdit+or+Notepad+and+typing+%E2%80%9C%26lt%3BHTML%26gt%3B%E2%80%9D+to+kick+off+a+new+project+%F0%9F%A4%93+These+60+helpful+web+development+tools+will+help+you+organize+and+optimize+your+experience+%E2%9C%85)\n\nWe’re going to give you a trigger warning before the next couple of words: “[crunch time](https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577).”\n\nYes, this dreaded phrase screams out for time-saving web development tools to save the day. The statistics show that [more projects utilize crunch](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#work-overtime) as a standard, and many development industries still use it today.\n\nRegardless of whether your company uses or needs crunch and overtime, web development tools can still help. These tools do the heavy lifting and automate mundane work that eats away at your day. As such, they offer an organic boost to your productivity.\n\nHowever, they can also offer a bonus if you operate under an agile project framework [such as Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/). For example, consider how a tool [such as JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) can help you share snippets with other teams during the tail of one sprint, ready for the next.\n\nWhat’s more, while daily stand-ups aren’t going anywhere, a Discord server or [Slack channel](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-use-slack/) could offer a better way to focus and align an upcoming set of tasks, away from the pressure of your current sprint’s goals.\n\nOn the whole, web development tools are as much about planning as they are about execution.\n\n## How to Choose the Right Development Stack For Your Project\n\nWe’re likely preaching to the converted, but a stellar web development tool is worth its weight in a rose gold [M1-powered MacBook](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/). As such, getting the right blend of tools for your specific project is crucial for building a solid foundation for work.\n\nIf it’s something you haven’t considered before, an [initial planning stage](https://kinsta.com/blog/trello-vs-asana/) will prove priceless. Taking some time to settle on the tools you’ll use does delay the coding phase of the project. However, you’ll get this time back later as there will be fewer potential software-related hassles. You’ll also see a more consistent output level (given that everyone will be on the same page).\n\n### Considerations for Choosing Your Development Stack\n\nChoosing the [right stack](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-a-technology-stack-choosing-the-right-tech-stack-for-your-web-project-3f295cf60f10) for the project boils down to the following:\n\n-   **Complexity:** Consider how complex your deliverable will need to be, as this will determine the complexity of the stack.\n-   **Scalability:** If your project is for a local business, this will need different solutions to a global enterprise. As such, you’ll need a more scalable stack to achieve your aims.\n-   **Security:** It almost goes without saying that whatever you choose shouldn’t compromise the [user and site security](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-use-ssh/).\n-   **Cost:** Of course, nobody likes to overspend, and if there are tight budgets involved, this will have more of a factor than a blank checkbook.\n\nThere are two areas you can split technologies into:\n\n-   **Server-side:** Here, you’ll want to look at the backend technologies you use. For example, you’ll want to look at your [choice of hosting](https://kinsta.com/clients/local-digital/) and web server, [key-value and SQL storage](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/), any app and automation frameworks you’ll use, and of course, the programming language.\n-   **Client-side:** Your frontend tool choices will arguably be more straightforward, especially when it comes to the languages you use. While [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-wordpress-code/) will feature, your choice of the JavaScript framework (and automation framework) will need some consideration.\n\nWhen it comes to some [real-world development stacks](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development#article_title_15), you’ll notice that many large sites use some combination of JavaScript and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), alongside [Nginx](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-nginx/). You’ll also see [Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/), [Redis](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/redis-cache/), and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) in development stacks.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s look at the list of web development tools we recommend using in 2021. We’ve organized them into categories, but otherwise, the tools are in no specific order. If you’re in a hurry, feel free to skip to a particular section listed below.\n\n1.

[Web Development References](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#web-development-references)\n\n### Local Development Environments\n\nA local development environment is an essential part of any development stack. However, it’s particularly vital for web development. Here are some of the most prominent local development tools.\n\n#### 1\\. DevKinsta\n\n![The DevKinsta splash screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devkinsta-splash.png)\n\nThe DevKinsta splash screen.\n\nWe may be biased, but [DevKinsta](https://kinsta.com/devkinsta/) could become the number one web development tool for 2021 and beyond.\n\nScratch that — we *are* biased, and we’re proud of what we’ve released!\n\nFor the uninitiated, DevKinsta is a way to help you spin up [local WordPress installations](https://kinsta.com/blog/install-wordpress-locally/) in a flash. It’s a complete suite that lets you design, develop, and deploy a WordPress site for macOS and Windows machines (with a Linux version in the pipeline).\n\nYou’re able to tailor your installation to your current project. For example, your “server” could use Nginx or Apache, your choice of PHP version, run [MariaDB or MySQL](https://kinsta.com/blog/mariadb-vs-mysql/), and much more:\n\n![DevKinsta’s setup options.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devkinsta-php-options.png)\n\nDevKinsta’s setup options.\n\nThere’s more under the hood too. You’re able to [debug and test](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-debug/) email too through the built-in [SMTP server](https://kinsta.com/blog/smtp-port/), and for database management, you can use the [powerful Adminer tool](https://kinsta.com/blog/adminer/):\n\n![DevKinsta’s Adminer-powered database manager.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devkinsta-adminer.png)\n\nDevKinsta’s Adminer-powered database manager.\n\nOverall, we think DevKinsta is ideal for modern WordPress development. It can slot straight into your workflow.\n\nWe’ve created this tool with developers, designers, freelancers, and agencies in mind. However, practically anyone with day-to-day development needs will find value in DevKinsta — especially (but not exclusively) Kinsta users.\n\nWhat’s more, DevKinsta is entirely free!\n\n#### 2\\. MAMP\n\n![The MAMP logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mamp-logo.png)\n\nThe MAMP logo.\n\nYou’d think that the classic tools for creating and deploying web pages are dead and buried, given the arrival of faster sandbox tools. However, traditional web service stacks, such as [LAMP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/), and [XAMPP,](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) are still going strong.\n\nTypically, they combine an Operating System (OS) — Linux, macOS, or Windows — along with [Apache webserver](https://kinsta.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache/), MySQL database, and Python, PHP, and Perl programming languages into one stack. As such, a web service stack like this will still get used in 2021.\n\nMAMP is the macOS-specific version of the tool. This approach sees you install a stack and work on design and deployment. While the process can be more long-winded than more modern setups, there’s still a similar level of flexibility under the hood — or at least, the potential is there.\n\nWhile in a tool such as DevKinsta, you’ll select from a slick Graphical User Interface (GUI), with a web service stack, you have to install the additions you need manually. For example, there’s no built-in way to spin up a WordPress site without “[rolling your own](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-localhost/).” It’s a similar situation with [testing email](https://documentation.mamp.info/en/MAMP-PRO-Windows/Servers-and-Services/Postfix/).\n\nAs with other local development environment tools, MAMP is entirely free. However, there’s also a [premium version of MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) for both Windows and Mac that ramps up the functionality and provides a comprehensive, robust web development tool.\n\n![The MAMP Pro dashboard.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mamp-pro.png)\n\nThe MAMP Pro dashboard.\n\nBecause of the flexibility and price, classic web service stacks are still on many developer computers. Command line aficionados will naturally gravitate to this solution, especially if you love using package managers such as [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), [Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/), or [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).\n\nOf course, Apache developers will use these stacks, too, as will MySQL and Python or PHP developers. By extension, WordPress developers will also feel at home here.\n\n#### 3\\. XAMPP\n\n![The XAMPP app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/xampp.png)\n\nThe XAMPP app.\n\n[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) is another web service stack that gets a lot of love from PHP developers, including those creating WordPress products. The “X” in the name represents the tool’s cross-platform nature. It offers installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux machines:\n\n![The XAMPP downloads page.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/xampp-downloads.png)\n\nThe XAMPP downloads page.\n\nWhile there used to be a difference between the various web service stacks, constant updates and improvements have equalized the field. Still, XAMPP has a couple of unique tricks up its sleeve.\n\nFor example, MySQL is no longer the default Relational Database Management System (RDMS). Instead, XAMPP uses MariaDB. It is likely a more accurate representation of a production server, given the switch to other solutions after [Oracle’s acquisition](https://www.tecmint.com/the-story-behind-acquisition-of-mysql-and-the-rise-of-mariadb/).\n\nIn addition, there’s a web app installer within the XAMPP package. [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp) is similar to solutions such as [Softaculous](https://www.softaculous.com/), but Bitnami is XAMPP-specific:\n\n![The Bitnami homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bitnami.png)\n\nThe Bitnami homepage.\n\nWhile there are [many apps available](https://www.apachefriends.org/add-ons.html), you’ll likely be most interested in the WordPress installer. Still, there are many add-ons to choose from, making XAMPP a flexible solution for local development.\n\n### Text and Code Editors\n\nMost developers love arguing about which code editor you should use. Okay, we’re hyperbolic, but there *are* plenty of opinions on the subject, with a fervent fanbase for each editor.\n\nHowever, if the [surveys are correct](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology), you’re probably using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It makes sense, as these three tools scale from simple text editing to fully-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE). However, there are others worth a mention too. Let’s take a look at a few of them.\n\n#### 4\\. Visual Studio Code\n\nSince its launch in 2015, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) use has exploded throughout development desktops of all stripes.\n\n![The Visual Studio Code Editor.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vscode-editor.png)\n\nThe Visual Studio Code Editor.\n\nIt’s an open source code editor developed by Microsoft that offers enough in the box to be considered an IDE. It’s undoubtedly offering enough functionality to capture over half of the market — [55% of web developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology) use Visual Studio Code daily.\n\nIn its default setup, Visual Studio Code is a text editor first and foremost. However, when coupled with its extension library, it becomes modular and flexible enough to meet any of your development needs:\n\n![The Visual Studio Code extensions library.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/code-extensions-llibrary.png)\n\nThe Visual Studio Code extensions library.\n\nIt means you can install linters and fixers for your chosen language (yes, ESLint and PHP CS Fixer are there), along with Docker and Vagrant extensions, and much more.\n\nSpeaking of languages, Visual Studio Code supports JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript out of the box. However, the extension ecosystem is so rich that you’ll be able to find something to support the language you’re using.\n\nWhat’s more, you’ll also find top-notch integration with other Microsoft products, most notably [GitHub](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology):\n\n![The Visual Studio Code GitHub integration.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/code-vcs.png)\n\nVisual Studio Code has a dedicated VCS integration with GitHub.\n\nVisual Studio is completely free, and given the feature set, it’s ideal for many. We consider VSCode to be an excellent middle ground between IDEA and Sublime Text. Speaking of which, let’s look at the latter next.\n\n#### 5\\. Sublime Text\n\n![The Sublime Text app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sublime-text.png)\n\nThe Sublime Text app.\n\n[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a mainstay within the world of text editors. It’s more pared down than most other solutions, though its appearance belies the power under the hood.\n\nFor example, you’ll see a lot of what Sublime Text offers in other competitors. The Command Palette is something you’ll see in many solutions because it’s straightforward to use.\n\n![Sublime Text’s Command Palette.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sublime-command-palette.png)\n\nSublime Text’s Command Palette.\n\nIn addition, there are powerful editing keyboard shortcuts, such as [making multiple selections](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/column_selection.html) to edit several columns at once. Also, the *Goto Anything* feature offers Vim-like combinations of keyboard shortcuts to traverse your files:\n\n![Sublime Text’s Goto Anything feature.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sublime-goto-anything.png)\n\nSublime Text can combine keystrokes to help you navigate.\n\nSublime Text is a premium tool with a very liberal trial period. It can be considered free, but to give back to the developer, you should [purchase a license](https://www.sublimehq.com/store/text) for extended use.\n\nIn our opinion, for many smaller or hobbyist coders, Sublime Text offers a great User Experience (UX), providing the bare essentials. It continues to find favor among many developers for its pleasing visuals, no-fuss layout, and extendability.\n\n#### 6\\. Atom\n\nAt one point, [Atom](http://atom.io/) enjoyed heavy usage among developers. However, since Visual Studio Code arrived, it’s seen less adoption. It is a shame because it’s a great code editor that’s suitable for many different applications.\n\n![The Atom app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/atom.png)\n\nThe Atom app.\n\nIt’s a GitHub-developed app, which may explain why it’s been shoved down the pecking order at Microsoft. However, it’s updated regularly and can be considered an alternative version of Visual Studio Code.\n\nText editing is functional, and like its bigger sibling, it has built-in GitHub integration. There are also many add-ons called “packages”:\n\n![Atom’s package installer.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/atom-package-manager.png)\n\nAtom’s package installer.\n\nThere are plenty available to help tailor Atom to your workflow and projects. Atom includes several themes to choose from, and some, such as One Dark, are so popular that they have found their way into other editors too:\n\n![Atom’s One Dark theme.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/atom-one-dark.png)\n\nAtom’s One Dark theme.\n\nAtom is a functional code editor that deserves a try. However, as Atom is [built on Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (no pun intended), some users have complained about large files and projects running slowly. As such, we’d suggest it’s good for smaller projects and quick scripts (especially with the built-in terminal package), but it may not be the best for complex work.\n\n#### 7\\. Notepad++\n\n![The Notepad++ homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/notepad-plus-plus.png)\n\nThe Notepad++ homepage.\n\nRight off the bat, it’s worth stating that [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) might not replace any of the “big boy” code editors you already use, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code. However, it will give you more power under the hood for simple scripts and general text editing applications.\n\nDepending on your projects, it might tempt you to switch. Despite its simplicity, Notepad++ is used across a wide variety of projects.\n\nIt’s a Windows-only code editor, which explains the “plus-plus” element of its name. Of course, [Notepad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-notepad/9msmlrh6lzf3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a no-nonsense text editor found by default on Windows installations. Notepad++ looks like its sibling, but it also includes development-specific features such as:\n\n-   Tabbed and split windows\n-   Support for nearly [80 programming languages](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/programing-languages/)\n-   [Auto-completion](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/auto-completion/) functionality\n-   A Function List, which offers a terrific way to view all of the functions used in a file at a glance\n\nWhat’s more, Notepad++ is flexible when it comes to project management. It supports three different approaches: sessions, workspaces, and projects. Once you start digging into Notepad++, you’ll see that you can use it for more extensive projects than single-page scripts.\n\nWe think Notepad++ is going to suit developers that want great functionality, which’s also customizable. On use, it’s got that open source Vim vibe going for it, which will suit certain types of projects more than others.\n\n#### 8\\. The JetBrains Suite\n\nWhen it comes to development IDEs, the [JetBrains suite of solutions](http://jetbrains.com/) is going to be at (or very near) the top of your list. The business model is clever, as while there are lots of editors available from JetBrains, they’re all actually “subsets” of its marquee editor, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).\n\n![IntelliJ IDEA is a leading Java IDE.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/intellij-idea.png)\n\nIntelliJ IDEA is a leading Java IDE.\n\nIDEA bills itself as a Java IDE. It supports practically all of the functionality of other IDE tools in its range. And as such, it supports many programming languages too.\n\nFor example, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) rips most of the Python functionality from IDEA and packages it as its own tool. You’ll also find [phpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) do the same thing.\n\n![The PyCharm app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pycharm.png)\n\nPyCharm is a Python-specific IDE that’s popular in the language space.\n\nUsing IDEA is a breeze — JetBrains has done a great job to get you coding rather than wading into configurations and settings. It may come as a surprise, but the line between using a command-line editor such as Vim and using IDEA is often thin.\n\nThere’s a similar focus on workflow and efficiency present in both tools, though IDEA also lets you import Vim keyboard bindings if you’re comfortable working in that way too.\n\n![IDEAs Vim keybindings extension.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/idea-vim.png)\n\nIDEA extensions let you use Vim keyboard bindings to make you feel like a Wizard.\n\nWe’d presuppose that you’re likely using IntelliJ IDEA if you’re working as part of a [large project](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-project-management-plugins/) or company with a software deal in place. It could be to share projects or to work in a consistent environment. Lots of WordPress developers are using JetBrains products because of how robust they are at managing projects.\n\nPrice is also a factor, and IntelliJ is built upon a [subscription model](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/buy/) that often runs into three or four figures per year.\n\n![IntelliJ IDEAs pricing screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/idea-pricing.png)\n\nIntelliJ IDEAs pricing screen.\n\nEven so, there *are* some “community” editions of JetBrains products. However, they’re cut-down versions of the parent software; essentially, they’re open source solutions with the proprietary elements taken out.\n\nWhat’s more, JetBrains offers competitive pricing for open source projects, startups, education facilities, Docker Captains, and lots more niche groups.\n\n### Web Design and Prototyping Tools\n\nOf course, a web app isn’t anything without a good User Experience (UX). As such, prototyping your layouts and visuals often needs a dedicated tool. [Design tools](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/) are going to be vital on both the server- and client-side of development. Here are a few popular choices.\n\n#### 9\\. Figma\n\n[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is an oft-mentioned web development tool that lets you collaborate on design.\n\n![The Figma editor.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/figma.png)\n\nThe Figma editor.\n\nYou can use the drag-and-drop editor to build interfaces and other user-facing elements. For developers, you can also grab code snippets to implant into your projects. Figma makes the process — from ideation to implementation — smooth and keeps revisions down along the entire project chain.\n\nYou also get the benefit of a homogenized set of tools to help with font and color choices. This process is in contrast to using separate tools such as [Type Scale](https://type-scale.com/):\n\n![The Type Scale website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/type-scale.png)\n\nThe Type Scale website.\n\n…and a subset of web development tools such as [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), various color pickers, and much more.\n\n![The Coolors color picker.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/coolors.png)\n\nThe Coolors color picker.\n\nWhile Figma has value for single-developer projects, it has more benefit for a team as it scales in size. Teams will like the collaborative aspects of Figma, such as the central asset repository and reusable components. Team leaders will also appreciate the comprehensive reporting options to see how the team members use the various design systems.\n\nAs for pricing, Figma costs $12 per “editor” on the [standard tier](https://www.figma.com/pricing/), which rises to $45 per “editor” for enterprise-based teams (for “editor,” read “seat” — it’s the same concept). As such, the price could rise based on how many editors you’d like onboard.\n\n#### 10\\. Sketch\n\n[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is a macOS-only app that’s also namechecked a lot among developers:\n\n![The Sketch logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sketch.png)\n\nThe Sketch logo.\n\nIt’s popular because Sketch includes lots of functionality under the hood, and it’s also a breeze to use, which makes sense given that it’s a native macOS app. It looks a little like [Apple’s Xcode IDE](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/), which is no bad thing, and it feels great to navigate.\n\nOf course, you can carry out essential functions such as vector editing and constraint resizing. However, there’s lots more in the app that will help you generate designs and export them to others in a quick way.\n\nFor example, take Sketch’s [Smart Layout](https://youtu.be/qrgDwQ0Fy1k) functionality, which uses adaptive resizing to match your dimensions and current layout. There are also many [collaborative tools](https://www.sketch.com/for-teams/) to give everyone a way to dive into a design and help perfect it.\n\n![An overview of Sketch for Teams.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sketch-teams.png)\n\nAn overview of Sketch for Teams.\n\nSketch differs from a tool such as Figma in that a freelancer or lone developer can jump on board for free, then purchase a subscription once there’s a need. In this regard, [Sketch’s pricing](https://www.sketch.com/pricing/) is either a one-off $99 payment or $9 per month per user.\n\n#### 11\\. InVision Studio\n\n[InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/) uniquely sells itself as a “screen design” app. It makes sense, and it’s clearer to understand too. InVision Studio provides all the standard features and functionality you’d expect, such as an intuitive layer-based editor and vector support.\n\n![The InVision Studio app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/invision-studio.png)\n\nThe InVision Studio app.\n\nThough, there’s much more in the box relating to prototyping and creating animations. For example, you can point, click, and drag to link artboards and screens together. This feature lets you build animations as part of the design process rather than as something you hand off later.\n\n![Animations within the InVision Studio app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/invision-animation.png)\n\nAnimations within the InVision Studio app.\n\nSpeaking of handoffs, the entire team can work within InVision Studio because of shared component libraries, global syncing options, a robust **Inspect** mode, and more.\n\nThe [pricing structure](https://www.invisionapp.com/plans) is competitive too. The free version of InVision Studio gives you almost all the functionality of the paid version, with only a restriction on the number of documents you can save. The Pro tier is valuable for the app’s power (around $95/user/year).\n\n#### 12\\. Affinity Designer\n\nIf you’re an Adobe Illustrator user, you’ll have come across [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) in the past. Serif’s approach to graphic design looks to give Adobe’s solution a run for its money:\n\n![The Affinity Designer app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/affinity-designer.png)\n\nThe Affinity Designer app.\n\nSince its launch, it’s gained a burgeoning user base due to its good rapport with the community, stellar design principles, and attractive pricing model. You’ll find versions for Mac, Windows, and iPad, and each version can work with vectors, rasters, or both at once:\n\n![Affinity Designer’s editor.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/affinity-editor.png)\n\nAffinity Designer’s editor.\n\nThe tools you’re used to from Illustrator are all present, along with a full suite of color profiles and export options:\n\n![The export options in Affinity Designer.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/affinity-export.png)\n\nThe export options in Affinity Designer.\n\nIn short, the features and functionality are in place to create professional graphics for your projects. What’s more, the pricing is uber-competitive. It costs around $50 at full price, which is a one-off payment. It doesn’t have an appropriate cloud-based option like Illustrator. Even so, for a one-off fee, you get the scope of Adobe presented in a subjectively better way.\n\n#### 13\\. CodePen or JSFiddle\n\nWhen discussing IntelliJ IDEA earlier, we didn’t mention one of its minor yet handy features — [Scratch files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/scratches.html). It lets you quickly write and test a code snippet without having to impact your current working project.\n\nFor users of other code editors, a solution such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) is an excellent substitute. They both work similarly: there are three text editors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and an output screen to see the result:\n\n![The CodePen console.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/codepen-example.png)\n\nThe CodePen console.\n\nYou can name your “Pen” or “Fiddle” depending on your platform, save it, and share it with others. It’s such a simple idea — one that can help you take your half-baked thoughts on an aspect of a project and realize them within seconds.\n\nFor developers who want to shine a light on a particular element within a file and show where changes are possible, an “online IDE” is invaluable. In addition, collaboration is also possible through chat or a “live mic”:\n\n![The JSFiddle Collaboration screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jsfiddle-chat.png)\n\nThe JSFiddle Collaboration screen.\n\nOverall, an online IDE could be considered a “sleeper” web development tool in that it’s not mentioned too often but is used by many developers to create better code.\n\n### Git Clients\n\nHaving a centralized way to store code, document the changes, and work on it with a team without duplication is a task for a [Version Control System (VCS)](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/). Here are a few clients that handle one VCS: git.\n\nLet’s discuss the VCS itself first.\n\n#### 14\\. Git\n\n[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is essential for a modern developer, and as such, it’s one of the most crucial web development tools available. In a nutshell, it’s a way to document the changes you make to your project’s code and store them in “repositories”:\n\n![A list of WordPress GitHub commits.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wordpress-commits.png)\n\nA list of WordPress GitHub commits.\n\nGit was invented by [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) creator Linus Torvalds. and uses a series of commands to add file changes to a “staging area,” where you’ll then “commit” them to a repository. From there, you’ll “push” them to a remote repository hosted online.\n\nWhile it isn’t the only VCS available — the WordPress development team [still uses Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) for many projects — it’s the most prominent. A VCS such as Git or Trac helps teams work together by hosting code in a central location.\n\nThe basic commands are single-word functions prefaced with git, often used from the command line. For example:\n\n```\ngit add file.php\n```\n\nThis expression adds **file.php** to your staging area. In other words, it records the changes as something you’d like to store without putting the finishing touches on it. You can do this with one file or an entire project if you wish.\n\nTo commit the file, you run `git commit`. From here, you can add a comment to tell others about your commits. After this, your changes are stored and pushed to the primary “branch.” Of course, that depends on whether you’re working on a remote “repo.”\n\nIf you’re new to Git and VCSs in general, GitLab has a [great beginner’s guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) to using Git on the command line. We’ll also talk a little about GitLab itself later on.\n\n#### 15\\. GitHub\n\n![Kinsta’s GitHub page.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kinsta-github.png)\n\nKinsta’s GitHub page.\n\nFor the [vast majority of developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-collaboration-tools-professional-developers2), [GitHub](https://github.com/) is *the* place where project Git repositories are stored:\n\n![Three of many WordPress GitHub repositories.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wordpress-repos.png)\n\nWordPress GitHub repositories.\n\nIt’s a Microsoft-owned solution that covers much more than Git hosting. There are a bunch of [automated testing](https://github.com/features#features-automation) tools too, and an attempt to offer [extra collaboration features](https://github.com/features#features-team-administration).\n\n![GitHub’s collaboration features.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/github-collaboration.png)\n\nGitHub’s collaboration features.\n\nFor open source projects, platforms [such as GitHub](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/) are almost the de-facto option. Given this, GitHub as a web development tool is priceless for many open source users, learners, and developers in general. It is especially true when digging into GitHub’s issue tracker to solve a problem with installed packages.\n\n![GitHub’s Issue Tracker.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/github-issue-tracker.png)\n\nGitHub’s Issue Tracker.\n\nGitHub isn’t just for storing program repos. It’s also for other coding projects, such as web development, and even books.\n\nOverall, GitHub is a fantastic tool that helps to build a healthy community from many disparate branches. However, it’s not the only platform around.\n\n#### 16\\. GitLab\n\n![The GitLab logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gitlab.png)\n\nThe GitLab logo.\n\nWe mentioned it earlier, but [GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) is a competitor to GitHub, with a similar goal. It’s essentially a host for Git repos but also offers a few other extras too.\n\nWhile GitHub calls itself a “development platform,” GitLab focuses on “DevOps.” On its free tier, GitLab offers every stage of the DevOps lifecycle, static application security testing, and around 400 minutes per month for Continuous Development (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI).\n\nGitLab falls in its sense of community, which is the big difference when it comes to GitHub. It’s more about deployment and the whole cycle of a project. It isn’t a negative, but it does mean GitLab is more of an “insular” platform, arguably not as suited to open source projects as GitHub.\n\nFor most teams, GitLab’s free tier will be plenty. For [around $230](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) per year, per user, you get access to analytics for your code and productivity, about 10,000 CD/CI minutes, and more.\n\n#### 17\\. Sourcetree\n\n[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) isn’t a Git repository host, but a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing them. It’s one of many solutions, such as [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and [many more](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).\n\n![The Sourcetree homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sourcetree.png)\n\nThe Sourcetree homepage.\n\nIt’s an Atlassian product (and we love Atlassian!) that connects with other products [such as Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to offer a visual representation of your Git repository.\n\nSourcetree is marketed as an easy Git client — and it is — but it’s also suitable for experienced users too. It has plenty under the hood to support a team working with Git (and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) too).\n\nFor example, Sourcetree does simple things, such as highlighting changes from the last commit, but it also tackles more if you need it. Team leaders can review changesets, work between branches as they need to, and visualize the code using graphs and information tabs:\n\n![Sourcetree’s graph view.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sourcetree-graphs.png)\n\nSourcetree’s graph view.\n\nWhether a Git client is right for you depends on your circumstances. If you’re still learning, we’d recommend keeping to a Terminal while you understand the flow and process. For professionals or teams with extensive Git usage, a client such as Sourcetree is going to shave minutes off of the work you do every day.\n\n### Browser Developer Tools\n\nWithout a web browser, there is no web development. However, while your chosen browser is critical for [navigating the web](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-clear-browser-cache/), you can also use it to find out how it runs.\n\nMost modern browsers include specific development tools to help you analyze backend code, which you can then take back into your project. Here are some of the most popular.\n\n#### 18\\. Chrome Developer Tools\n\n[Chrome’s “DevTools”](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) are revered throughout communities for its stellar feature set and diagnostics.\n\nGiven the [rise of Chromium-based browsers](https://kinsta.com/browser-market-share/), many have the same set of DevTools with similar shortcuts. You can check out [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedgewelcome.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Brave](https://kinsta.com/blog/brave-browser-review/), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) itself, and many more clones and work with your projects within the browser.\n\n![The DevTools found in the Brave Browser.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/brave-devtools.png)\n\nBrave browser’s DevTools.\n\nThe **Elements** tab will be a regular haunt, as this is where you’ll view the page source code. And in our opinion, the **Performance** tab gives page load insights that other browser DevTools can’t match:\n\n![Brave’s Performance tab.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/brave-performance.png)\n\nBrave’s Performance tab.\n\nThe **Security** tab gives some good information too, which will be necessary for monitoring (or researching) a client’s website:\n\n![Brave’s Security tab.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/brave-security.png)\n\nBrave’s Security tab.\n\nEven better, you’ll be able to generate [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) reports direct from your Chromium-based browser:\n\n![A Google Lighthouse report from Brave’s DevTools.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/brave-lighthouse.png)\n\nA Google Lighthouse report from Brave’s DevTools.\n\nThe DevTools here are subjectively the best around, so you’ll find Chrome and Chromium-based users will lean on them. Though other browsers have DevTools too, and they’re also worth consideration.\n\n#### 19\\. Firefox Developer Tools\n\n![The Firefox homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firefox.png)\n\nThe Firefox homepage.\n\nWith a monthly active user base of [around 220 million](https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity), Firefox is still a popular browser, despite Google’s dominance. In the past, developers [lauded Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/), and it was often a leader in debugging within the browser.\n\nToday, we have Firefox’s Developer Tools:\n\n![Firefox’s developer tools.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firefox-dev-tools.png)\n\nFirefox’s developer tools.\n\nThere is a core set of features for viewing site source code (**Inspector**), a **Debugger**, **Memory**, **Storage**, and more.\n\nFor beginners, the **Console** is a gateway to coding in general because you’re able to run JavaScript directly in the browser, and it’s an easy way to test out snippets and find your feet when first starting:\n\n![An example of a browser console.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/web-console.png)\n\nAn example of a browser console.\n\nDespite this, we think Firefox (and other browsers) has less packed into its Developer Tools than Chromium-based browsers. Still, for cross-browser debugging and troubleshooting, you’ll often press Firefox into service. As such, it’s a good thing they’re ideal for almost all tasks.\n\n### Frontend Frameworks\n\nSpeaking of frontend, you’ll need something suitable for creating stunning websites. Your choice of the framework here is crucial. You should always select the best tool for the job.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s look at a few popular choices.\n\n#### 20\\. Bootstrap\n\nMobile responsiveness is a standard feature in modern web design. It’s a welcome step, given how [mobile browsing](https://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/) has now overtaken desktops. Given this, you’ll want a way of spinning up mobile-first sites quickly.\n\n[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a great web development tool that is seeing plenty of use:\n\n![The Bootstrap logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bootstrap.png)\n\nThe Bootstrap logo.\n\nIt’s a toolkit that combines JavaScript plugins, [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/), some pre-built components, a quality [responsive grid system](https://kinsta.com/partners/wpgridbuilder/), and much more. There’s even a [marketplace of official themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/) that work with Bootstrap, and plenty of WordPress websites also use themes built on top of the design framework.\n\nOf course, whether or not you use Bootstrap will depend on what your project needs. However, it’s logical to assume that web development projects with tight budgets and quick turnarounds will turn to a “Bootstrapped” solution and adapt it to WordPress. Given that the framework and WordPress are free, your time becomes the only cost factor.\n\n#### 21\\. Tailwind CSS\n\nOn paper, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) doesn’t make sense. It’s a frontend framework for a language that’s part of the core trinity of web development. As such, it’s logical to think that the target user would already have the proper knowledge without the need for a framework.\n\nIn reality, Tailwind CSS makes *perfect* sense. It’s a way to design the frontend of your site without leaving HTML.\n\n![A Tailwind CSS example.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tailwind-css.png)\n\nA Tailwind CSS example.\n\nYou use utility classes within various tags to add in CSS from a core StyleSheet. Of course, CSS is still the primary styling source. It’s just out of your view as you build a layout using HTML. Thus, it lets you develop structure and style at the same time.\n\nThe approach reminds us of the [960 Grid System](https://960.gs/) and would work well dovetailing with that framework. That said, there’s a danger of packing elements with so many classes that you could end up with a mess of spaghetti code. You’ll need patience and discipline to work with Tailwind CSS, but if it fits your project, it’s a quick and robust framework.\n\n#### 22\\. Bulma\n\nWe’ve made all of the progress we’ve made with designing site structures and layouts, creating flexible, responsive, and dynamic columns a roadblock for many. While handling this isn’t the only thing [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) can do, this type of application is meat and potatoes to the framework:\n\n![The Bulma website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bulma.png)\n\nThe Bulma website.\n\nMuch like Tailwind CSS, Bulma hides the CSS and gives you utility classes for your HTML. It’s built with Flexbox, mobile-first, and modular. It’s great if you only need a few components. You can also mix and match frameworks if you wish.\n\nWhat’s more, you don’t need any JavaScript to get Bulma up and running, as it’s CSS only. You’re able to add interface elements such as buttons with the bare minimum of code. It’s a straightforward, open source framework that can adapt to your own project’s needs. In our book, that’s a valuable trait you’d do well to leverage.\n\n#### 23\\. Foundation\n\nThe ZURB team has its unique take on a CSS framework in [Foundation](https://get.foundation/). It’s a mobile-first, semantic tool that has two flavors for sites and email:\n\n![The Foundation homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/foundation.png)\n\nThe Foundation homepage.\n\nFoundation is built with accessibility as a priority. Every snippet in Foundation comes with dedicated ARIA attributes. However, before you get to this stage, Foundation is impressive for rapid prototyping because of how you add it to your HTML. You’re able to create almost any structural element on your page — even various types of menus and navigation:\n\n![Creating a navigation menu in Foundation.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/foundation-menu.png)\n\nCreating a navigation menu in Foundation.\n\nZURB also provides a wealth of excellent [documentation and tutorials](https://get.foundation/learn/tutorials.html) for you to learn the ins and outs of the framework. Foundation is simple to use, but we suspect you can go deep into building sites and come out with complex layouts and functionality.\n\nYou’ll also find a [bunch of templates](https://get.foundation/templates.html) on the Foundation website too. They’re bare-bones wireframes to help you get off the ground — a welcome inclusion:\n\n![Foundation’s template library.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/foundation-templates.png)\n\nFoundation’s template library.\n\nOn the whole, the Foundation framework does what it says on the tin. It’s going to be central to your site’s development, rather than letting you bolt on more functionality. As such, you may not be using it for every project. Though, where employed, it will do the business on all manner of sites.\n\n#### 24\\. Material-UI\n\nWe’ll discuss React in more detail later, but for now, know that [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is based on this JavaScript framework’s component library. For the unaware, Material Design is Google’s “philosophy” on how to design a website’s frontend. It means lots of Roboto fonts and blocks of color:\n\n![Material-UI looks to meet Google’s design standards.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-ui.png)\n\nMaterial-UI looks to meet Google’s design standards.\n\nYou’ll import the library into React, then use dedicated HTML tags to build out your site:\n\n![Building a button in Material-UI.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-ui-button.png)\n\nCreating a button in Material-UI.\n\nTo customize the element further, you add classes to your HTML tags. The whole block of code is wrapped in a function, and you’ll render the details (and the page by extension) in React.\n\nThere are a lot of [free and premium themes](https://material-ui.com/store/) available, too, covering many use cases and prices:\n\n![The Material-UI theme library.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-ui-themes.png)\n\nThe Material-UI theme library.\n\nSince Material-UI has one specific use case — creating sites around Material Design — it will be a go-to framework if this is your goal. In particular, the theme library will be a valuable resource for getting started, regardless of your budget.\n\n#### 25\\. HTML5 Boilerplate\n\n![The HTML5 Boilerplate homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/html5-boilerplate.png)\n\nThe HTML5 Boilerplate homepage.\n\nIf you’re a WordPress developer, you may have come across [Underscores](https://underscores.me/). It’s a bare-bones WordPress starter theme that saves you countless hours putting together your site’s functional and core elements. [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) does the same on a general design level.\n\nAs such, it includes seven files spanning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They all contain only the most necessary files and code to render a page. Beyond that point, how your page turns out is up to you.\n\nHTML5 Boilerplate has many fans because it’s more of a timesaver utility than a full-fledged framework. Thus, there are no visuals out of the box to wow “passing trade,” but if you press HTML5 Boilerplate into service, you may find it speeds up your development the way Underscores does for WordPress developers.\n\n#### 26\\. Materialize\n\nWhile we wouldn’t call [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) a competitor to Material-UI, it’s another framework that looks to use the principles of Material Design to create a layout:\n\n![The Materialize homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/materialize.png)\n\nThe Materialize homepage.\n\nRather than using React, though, Materialize is a CSS framework. That makes Materialize easier to implement on the frontend. Much like other CSS-based frameworks, you use classes within the HTML to pull in elements on the frontend.\n\nThat said, there are a bunch of JavaScript components, too, for elements such as modals and dropdowns:\n\n![A dropdown menu created with Materialize.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/materialize-dropdown.png)\n\nA dropdown menu created with Materialize.\n\nLike many of these frameworks, there are [premium themes](https://materializecss.com/themes.html) that help you build layouts in a specific style. They’re all static HTML themes, though, which might prove a problem if you want to implement JavaScript. In these cases, you may want to consider Material-UI instead.\n\n### Web Application Frameworks\n\nSimply put, a [JavaScript framework or library](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/) lets you work with the so-called “vanilla” code differently. In this instance, it’s to create specific web applications and sites. There are plenty of “flavors” too — let’s cover a few.\n\n#### 27\\. React.js\n\n![An example of React sandbox code.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/react-js.png)\n\nAn example of React sandbox code.\n\n[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular Facebook-designed JavaScript library that powers many of the more modern WordPress elements. Both the [WordPress.com backend](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/) and the Block Editor use React, and we’d consider it an interface-first way of using JavaScript.\n\n![The Calypso backend for WordPress.com is built on React.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wordpress-com.png)\n\nThe Calypso backend for WordPress.com is built on React.\n\nAs such, WordPress developers should — to [paraphrase Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt/2015/12/state-of-the-word-2015/) — learn React.js deeply. Though, it’s not only a framework for WordPress developers.\n\nAnywhere you need a modern and dynamic User Interface (UI), React will be the first-choice consideration. It uses a syntax extension to JavaScript called JSX to create elements, which are then rendered to the Document Object Module (DOM):\n\n### Want to know how we increased our traffic over 1000%?\n\nJoin 20,000+ others who get our weekly newsletter with insider WordPress tips!\n\n[Subscribe Now](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/#newsletter)\n\n```\nconst name = \"Ken Starr';\n\nconst element = \u003ch1\u003eHello, {name}\u003c/h1\u003e;\n\nReactDOM.render\n  Element,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nThe JavaScript variable within the JSX can be any valid expression, which lets you build complex arguments. That makes React a strong choice when it comes to frameworks. Because of its popularity, we think [React should be on your “must-learn” list](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/#reactjs), regardless of where you spend your development time.\n\n#### 28\\. Vue.js\n\n[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is another JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It’s based in the “view layer” and is great for integrating with other libraries and frameworks.\n\n![The Vue.js sandbox.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vue-js.png)\n\nThe Vue.js sandbox.\n\nOn the HTML side, Vue couldn’t be more accessible. You give your tag an ID and call a key from a dictionary set on the JavaScript side. The data is now reactive, and the data and DOM are linked.\n\nIn this way, Vue.js is a lot like some of the CSS frameworks we looked at earlier in the article. This framework is compelling, and we encourage you to look [through the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) to see what’s possible.\n\nWhile Vue.js supports JSX declarations, it’s better suited to using templates based on the “classic” web technologies. As such, it’s going to be ideal for developers who don’t want to work in JavaScript only.\n\n#### 29\\. Express.js\n\nWe’re getting into meta-framework territory here, as [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) connects to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and provides a base for other frameworks.\n\n![The Express.js homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/express.png)\n\nThe Express.js homepage.\n\nIt’s a minimalist framework (hence the name), and a prime benefit is to help you organize server-side components into a familiar Model-View-Controller (MVC) format. As such, the code looks more complicated than other frameworks — even vanilla JavaScript:\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.send(\"Hello world!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nWe think that Express.js is going to suit applications that pull and push from databases a lot. That makes it suitable for many modern web applications and backend developers who want to work on frontend tasks with a minimum of stress.\n\n#### 30\\. Svelte.js\n\nOne solid rule of thumb when developing for the web is to make sure your sites work on as many browsers as possible. That said, in some cases, you may want to build apps or websites without supporting legacy browsers. In these instances, [Svelte.js](http://sveltejs.com/) ought to be near the top of your list.\n\n![The Svelte.js homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/svelte.png)\n\nThe Svelte.js homepage.\n\nThe framework gets its name due to its file size — a mere 5kb once minified. It has a jQuery-like format that will be easy for familiar users:\n\n```\n$('.hello').text(\"Hello svelte\");\n```\n\nThere are under 40 functions within the Svelte API, so getting started will be straightforward. What’s more, you can add new functions with ease using `$.fn`.\n\nYou’ll find “polyfills” for Internet Explorer 9 support, but this is almost the only concession. For hyper-modern browser support using a super-lean framework, Svelte.js could be the one for you.\n\n#### 31\\. Laravel\n\nSo far, we’ve looked at JavaScript or CSS frameworks. Given the prevalence of PHP, it makes sense to cover a framework for this language too. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is the ideal choice here, as it’s popular among many developers for its syntax and ecosystem:\n\n![The Laravel homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/laravel.png)\n\nThe Laravel homepage.\n\nIt’s more apt to say that [Laravel is an ecosystem](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-laravel/), as it includes lots of tools to help you build up projects. Even if you don’t use much of the framework itself, you may use [Laravel’s Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead), a Vagrant-based local development environment.\n\nLaravel itself is a Docker-based PHP framework and uses a CLI (called Sail) to interact with it. Much like Vagrant, you’ll use sail up to build containers and run them.\n\nLaravel has lots more strings to its bow, though. For example, you can use it as a full-stack framework, an API backend for Next.js apps, and almost everything in between.\n\nIf you’re a PHP developer, Laravel will be a central (if not familiar) tool to your workflow.\n\n#### 32\\. Gatsby\n\n[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is an open source frontend framework that has garnered a lot of attention of late. It’s because Gatsby is fast, scalable, performant, and secure.\n\n![The Gatsby homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gatsby.png)\n\nThe Gatsby homepage.\n\nThere’s a [super-fast installation process](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) involving the Node Package Manager (npm). We’ll have more on this later. Although it’s a JavaScript framework, Gatsby generates static HTML files at run time, so there’s no way to attack a site. What’s more, Gatsby automates performance to keep your site running in an optimal configuration.\n\nBetween the automated performance, the dynamic scaling, and the static HTML building, Gatsby feels like a living organism. There’s a complex coding “makeup” involving JSX, Markdown, CSS, and much more based on your needs. Every [step of your workflow](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/) and piece of your stack can be tailored to your requirements.\n\nWordPress developers will also like how [Gatsby integrates with the platform](https://kinsta.com/blog/gatsby-wordpress/). It’s not going to be suitable in all cases, though. For example, if you need to manage a cloud-based CMS fully, this isn’t for you. Even so, Gatsby can adapt to your project in most cases, and it works great with WordPress.\n\n#### 33\\. Django\n\nFor all the talk of Python being a “beginner” or “learning” programming language, it serves as the backbone to many high-profile sites. Some of the [largest websites](https://learn.onemonth.com/10-famous-websites-built-using-python/) — Instagram, Uber, Reddit, Pinterest, and more — use Django. Often, you’ll find no mention of Python itself, [but only Django](https://djangoproject.com/).\n\nDjango is a framework that uses Python to create server-side web applications. It’s as straightforward to use as Python itself, with an uber-readable format.\n\n![Django’s default formatting.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/django-formatting.png)\n\nDjango’s default formatting.\n\n[Python is](https://kinsta.com/blog/scripting-languages/#3-python) a great scripting language for logic-based projects, so leveraging this for a web application is a good fit. What’s more, Python’s processing speed is fast, and the fundamental file structure is light. Because it’s speedy, Django is an excellent server-side framework compared to PHP and has just as much grunt as the more popular language.\n\nThat said, uptake is lower, which might be due to Python’s reputation as a learner language. Despite this, Django works well with other languages, such as JavaScript, to be the basis of a modern web app.\n\nOf course, if you plan to use a CMS such as WordPress, or you’re creating solutions for React-based projects, you have fewer options. Even so, we think 2021 will see a rise in the number of sites running on Django.\n\n#### 34\\. Ruby on Rails\n\nThe Ruby programming language was the “darling” of beginner languages and scripting alternatives to PHP a few years ago. It is often compared to Python.\n\nAnd much like Django, [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) was also a favorite of many developers.\n\n![The placeholder page when starting a Ruby on Rails project.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ruby-on-rails.png)\n\nThe placeholder page for a new Ruby on Rails project.\n\nYou’ll find Ruby used in a lot of server-side and under-the-hood web applications. In addition, Ruby on Rails is used as a server-side framework on countless websites. It uses an MVC approach and offers structures for the web service, pages, and a database. As such, you have a barebones site waiting for you, out of the box.\n\nRuby on Rails will suit your project if it needs to schedule many jobs and work with third-party solutions. For example, there is native integration with file storage such as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), and a wrapper for sending emails.\n\nOn the whole, it’s a good choice if you want a robust set of defaults (such as folder structure) that can be customized if needed. On the other hand, it’s not a great choice if you like using APIs during development.\n\nThe code structure of Ruby on Rails can become complex and challenging to understand with big projects. Run time can also be affected, so it might not be the best framework for speed-critical projects.\n\nStill, Ruby on Rails is one of the leading web server-side frameworks, and its use isn’t slowing down for suitable projects.\n\n### 35\\. TypeScript\n\n![An example of TypeScript code.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/typescript-code.png)\n\nAn example of TypeScript code.\n\nIn a nutshell, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) provides optional static “typechecking” to JavaScript. It’s a “superset” of the language, and it also supports lots of other JavaScript libraries. On the whole, TypeScript is JavaScript with a few extra features, and you can compile both languages alongside each other.\n\nMany developers have turned to TypeScript to reduce the number of runtime errors they get. Type errors are [one of the most common](http://gria.org/programming-errors-three-common-types/), and reducing them could give you a lot of extra time back.\n\nFor a very simple example of TypeScript, consider a string:\n\nlet helloWorld = “Hello World”;\n\n//  ^ = let helloWorld: string\n\nHere, TypeScript uses let rather than the usual var for the helloWorld variable. From there, TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string and checks it on this basis.\n\nUltimately, TypeScript isn’t an essential web development tool, though it’s become more popular due to its core marquee feature. If you end up saving some much-needed time, it could become vital to your workflow.\n\n### 36\\. GraphQL\n\nHere’s a unique tool that may find favor among developers working with the data within an API. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language used in an API that also acts as a run time for serving the results of the query you make.\n\n![The GraphQL website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphql.png)\n\nThe GraphQL website.\n\nWith a standard REST API, you often have to load from multiple URLs. With GraphQL, you can fetch data from a single request. What’s more, the GraphQL APIs are arranged by type rather than endpoints. This classification helps the efficiency of your query and provides more explicit errors when something goes wrong.\n\nTypes can also be used to skip overwriting manual parsing code, given how GraphQL implements them. You’re also able to add new fields and types to your API without impacting the work you’ve done so far.\n\nThe tool is flexible and scalable in many areas. Because GraphQL creates a uniform API for your project, you can pull in an engine matching your chosen project language. That makes it great for a wide gamut of applications, rather than a niche solution to a widespread problem.\n\nYou’ll find GraphQL used on sites such as GitHub, Spotify, Facebook, and more. It should give you an idea of how GraphQL is used on query-heavy sites of all stripes. As such, you may need to pull on this solution more than once over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\n### Package Managers\n\nProgramming languages, frameworks, and more have many moving parts. These dependencies must be downloaded and installed in the right way to work. Enter package managers. These help you download and install specific dependencies from the command line. Let’s run down a few tools you’ll come across.\n\n#### 37\\. Node Package Manager (npm)\n\nYes, downloading installers has its place. However, using a package manager from the command line is super simple in most cases. It also provides a zippy way to grab and install files from the web.\n\nThe [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a JavaScript-specific web development tool owned by Microsoft that lets you install language-specific packages on-demand:\n\n![The npm homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/npm.png)\n\nThe npm homepage.\n\nFor example, searching for React packages brings up over 155,000 results:\n\n![A search performed within npm.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/npm-react-search.png)\n\nA search performed in npm.\n\nAs with an online IDE, npm is a web development tool that doesn’t get a lot of “airtime,” mainly because it’s ubiquitous. As such, practically every web developer is going to use this tool.\n\nHowever, it’s incredible, and now that it’s under GitHub’s wing, more developers will use npm in 2021 than ever before.\n\n#### 38\\. Yarn\n\nMuch like npm and pip for Python, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) helps you install packages related to your project and its tools. The difference here is that Yarn is also a project management tool.\n\n![The Yarn homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yarn.png)\n\nThe Yarn homepage.\n\n[Installation is simple](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), and initializing Yarn for a new project also takes a [minimum of effort](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage). It’s become a robust [open source solution](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#is-yarn-operated-by-facebook) for installing packages and managing your project alongside.\n\nYou’ll [use workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) to create “monorepos,” and multiple versions of your project both live in the same repo and can be cross-referenced. You can install plugins for anything Yarn can’t do (for which you want to add new fetchers and resolvers). To be more accurate, you *could* install plugins, but there [aren’t too many](https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins#official-plugins), at least in the official lists. Instead, you’ll code your own if you’re desperate for the functionality. Still, the choice is there to customize Yarn to your project’s needs.\n\nYarn makes a unique case to become your primary package manager. For a real-world project, you may lean on npm more, but Yarn will sneak into your workflow in ways that can only benefit you.\n\n### API and Testing Tools\n\nMaking sure things work is an oft-skipped process, but it also comes with regrets when things go wrong. As such, the testing phase of your project should be solid, robust, and thorough.\n\nGiven this, here are some API and testing tools you’ll have on hand for your projects.\n\n#### 39\\. HoppScotch\n\nPowered by Netlify, [HoppScotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) is an open source API development tool. The developers call it an “ecosystem,” which belies the functionality under the hood.\n\n![The main HoppScotch page.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hoppscotch.png)\n\nThe main HoppScotch page.\n\nIt’s a no-nonsense and robust solution, and not for the faint of heart. The learning curve if you’ve never used a tool like this is steep. There is almost no direction on using HoppScotch on any of the app’s pages, though this isn’t usually a problem, as the tool is meant for experienced developers anyway.\n\nThere are many real-time connections (WebSocket, SSE, and more), and a GraphQL implementation. We also like the documentation creator:\n\n![The HoppScotch documentation creator screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hoppscotch-documentation.png)\n\nThe HoppScotch documentation creator screen.\n\nIt works with your HoppScotch “collections” to create documentation on the fly, which is a welcome time-saver.\n\nOn the whole, HoppScotch is a functional tool that will be open a lot in your browser. It’s one of those solutions that you’ll always use without realizing it — we can’t give it higher praise than that!\n\n#### 40\\. Postman\n\n![The Postman logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/postman-logo.png)\n\nThe Postman logo.\n\nWarning — we’re about to mention the dreaded “C” word: _collaboration_. [Postman](http://postman.com/) is a web development tool that helps you create an [Application Programming Interface (API)](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-rest-api/) as a team through the Postman platform:\n\n![The Postman dashboard.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/postman-dashboard.png)\n\nThe Postman dashboard.\n\nThere are plenty of [use cases](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/) for integrating Postman into your workflow. For example, you can use it in a standard way for application development, which will directly translate into web-based projects. You could simulate endpoints using mock servers, which is going to appeal to WordPress developers especially.\n\nYou’re even able to [create onboarding](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/developer-onboarding/) to help users of your APIs learn the ropes. Those projects where there is plenty of user turnover or significant traffic will see the benefit here.\n\nAs for pricing, Postman offers a free tier, but you’ll get the most value from one of the [premium tiers](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). You’ll look to pay around $12–30, depending on your billing cycle and number of users.\n\n#### 41\\. Testing Library\n\nCode that runs is ideal, yet apps that work are the end goal. [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) does as its name suggests: it provides a set of utilities to help you test your projects and encourage you to use good coding practices.\n\n![The Testing Library homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/testing-library.png)\n\nThe Testing Library homepage.\n\nThe idea is that you create tests that represent your app usage. If they run without a hitch, the chances are good that your app will too. It’s an agnostic tool regarding framework, and it’s not a test runner. The core purpose of Testing Library is to help you write maintainable tests uncoupled from the implementation details.\n\nEverything within the Testing Library tool centers around its [guiding principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/). As such, you’re not only creating tests — you’re learning how to make them better and more valuable.\n\nBecause of this, Testing Library could become a big part of your workflow. We’d argue that almost all project chains could benefit from Testing Library, and React users will almost certainly want to instate this tool as a standard.\n\n### Collaboration Tools\n\nDespite the trope of developers being antisocial, the truth is that tech and collaboration go hand in hand.\n\nAs such, let’s round-up some stellar collaboration tools that will slot into your next project.\n\n#### 42\\. Jira\n\n[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software) is a well-liked company when it comes to software. We’re big fans of a few of the company’s offerings: Confluence, Trello, Sourcetree, Bitbucket, and our focus here, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/).\n\n![The Jira homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jira.png)\n\nThe Jira homepage.\n\nIt’s a development tool for teams using [Agile frameworks](https://airfocus.com/glossary/what-is-an-agile-framework/) — Scrum in particular, as it’s so popular. Because of this, you get a wealth of features in the package. For example, you’re able to use kanban boards to help organize tasks and sprints. You can also implement your estimation technique, custom to your methodology and project.\n\nJira focuses on a repeatable workflow: plan, track, release, and report. It is central to several Agile frameworks, though you can also create your own depending on your pre-project planning. If you have to pivot between sprints, you can evolve your project and scale up or down.\n\nThe great news about Jira is that there’s a free tier to get you started, and [reasonable pricing](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing) for the other tiers. That said, you’ll find that a team of ten will be the minimum requirement for using Jira effectively. It could be overkill for any smaller group.\n\n#### 43\\. Taskade\n\nWhen it comes to collaborative tools, it’s rare to find [Taskade.](https://www.taskade.com/) It does the app a disservice, as it’s a fantastic tool for keeping a team focused and on topic.\n\n![The Taskade dashboard.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/taskade.png)\n\nThe Taskade dashboard.\n\nIf you’re a user of other collaboration tools such as Asana or Basecamp (more on both later), you’ll be at home here. The information you need most, such as to-dos and reminders, is centralized under the hood. Thus, you can present it in many ways depending on your project.\n\n![The presentation types in Taskade.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/taskade-list-types.png)\n\nThe presentation types in Taskade.\n\nThe “Mindmap” and “Org Chart” view types are stellar, and each gives you a different perspective on the information you’ve added.\n\n![A mind map in Taskade.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/taskade-mindmap.png)\n\nA mind map in Taskade.\n\nThe app is deceptive in its simplicity. Other than a flexible way to present and manage tasks, there’s little else on offer.\n\nWorking with your team takes a handful of button presses. For example, every screen has an expandable chat window:\n\n![The Taskade chat window.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/taskade-chat.png)\n\nThe Taskade chat window.\n\nTo some, especially when compared to other solutions, Taskade could be seen as barebones and even underequipped. However, it isn’t the case. Taskade a fantastic way to collaborate with a team, and because of its simplicity, it will slot straight into whatever project you’re working on.\n\n#### 44\\. Asana\n\n![The Asana homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/asana.png)\n\nThe Asana homepage.\n\n[Asana](http://asana.com/) is one of the more prominent names in the field of collaboration tools. It’s a monster when it comes to grabbing a project and whipping it into shape with the help of a team. Asana is also great at adapting to different workflows. For example, you can switch between lists and calendars, but also access timelines too.\n\n![Asana’s workflow types.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/asana-workflow-types.png)\n\nAsana’s workflow types.\n\nThere are some fantastic team-based features and functionality as well. Reporting is comprehensive, and [on higher plans](https://asana.com/pricing), you get access to a dashboard that shows various analytics relating to your team’s performance. There’s even a way to monitor workloads for each team member. Thus, Asana helps you keep crunch to a minimum and prevents team members from burning out.\n\nWhat’s more, the free tier isn’t a crippled demo of the full-featured app. You can scale Asana as you scale a team, and there’s good functionality here to help you. For example, you’re able to assign work to team members and manage each workflow. You’re also able to send general messages on a per-workspace basis to the entire team.\n\n![Sending a message in Asana.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/asana-messages.png)\n\nSending a message in Asana.\n\nIt’s an old hand at collaborative project management, but Asana delivers almost every time. You’ll find that a good portion of your clients and teammates have an Asana account too, which means assembling within the app will happen more often than you might assume.\n\n#### 45\\. Basecamp\n\n[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) is another big player in team-based project management. It’s one of the old guards, having been around nearly as long as WordPress itself. The core software has been around much longer, so it has a pedigree and track record worth noting.\n\n![The Basecamp homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/basecamp.png)\n\nThe Basecamp homepage.\n\nOn paper, nothing is exciting about Basecamp compared to the competition. In honesty, many of the other collaborative apps have caught up to what Basecamp offers. It isn’t the whole story, though.\n\nYes, you can create tasks and to-do lists, assign them to team members, and work with everything on a project-wide basis. Basecamp’s killer features, though, are infrastructure and design.\n\nThere’s a simple approach to using Basecamp: create a project, develop your to-do list or schedule, and assign the tasks to teammates. Each project has a bunch of self-contained aspects that help you get a project over the line:\n\n![The elements that make up a Basecamp project.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/basecamp-project-screen.png)\n\nThe elements that make up a Basecamp project.\n\nAs we said, there’s nothing groundbreaking here, but that’s the point. Basecamp is a dependable project management system without many bells and whistles. As such, you’ll keep coming back to it because it’s [reliable and extendable](https://basecamp.com/extras) based on your needs.\n\n### Task Runners\n\nWorking on the tiny tasks within a web development project presents a problem. They’re necessary to make you more efficient and productive. You have to expend time and energy to get these micro-tasks over the line on the flip side.\n\nTo help, you’ll need a task runner. Here are a few of our favorites.\n\n#### 46\\. Grunt\n\n![The Grunt homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grunt-js.png)\n\nThe Grunt homepage.\n\n[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) is a JavaScript-specific task runner that looks to automate some of the [mundane and repetitive tasks](https://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) you’ll encounter daily. Consider tasks you may typically consider ordinary: linting, [minification](https://kinsta.com/blog/enable-gzip-compression/), compilation, and many more.\n\nGrunt handles these for you through a [JSON-based configuration file](https://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) (called a “Gruntfile”). Here’s an example:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) {\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      files: ['Gruntfile.js', \"src/**/*.js', \"test/**/*.js'],\n      options: {\n        globals: {\n          jQuery: true\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      files: ['\u003c%= jshint.files %\u003e'],\n      tasks: ['jshint']\n    }\n  });\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n  grunt.registerTask('default', ['jshint']);\n};\n```\n\nIf you often find your projects losing time through routine tasks, Grunt will likely become part of your box of web development tools as it already is for [WordPress, Bootstrap](https://gruntjs.com/who-uses-grunt), and many others.\n\n#### 47\\. Gulp\n\n![The Gulp logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gulp.png)\n\nThe Gulp logo.\n\nWhen you compare task runners, it’s often a shootout between Gulp and Grunt. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a JavaScript-based toolkit for automating your workflow and increasing your efficiency.\n\nYou’ll use dedicated files and “streams” to act on your assets and code before it’s written to disk. Each task you create is an “asynchronous” function, and you can set it is as either private or public. The difference is one of the permissions: private tasks can’t be run by the end-user and are designed to work with other functions.\n\nSpeaking of which, you can use the series() and parallel() functions to create tasks. It means you can take small tasks, make them one cog in a more extensive system, and then nest them.\n\nWhat’s more, you’re also able to extend the functionality of Gulp through [community-created plugins](https://gulpjs.com/plugins/):\n\n![A showcase of Gulp plugins.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gulp-plugins.png)\n\nA showcase of Gulp plugins.\n\nIt may be a generalization, but both Gulp and Grunt are good at different things. Gulp is solid when it comes to working with assets that may be a part of a more extensive set of instructions. Because of this, you’ll want to choose the proper task runner on a per-project basis.\n\n### Containerization Tools\n\nWe’ll go out on a limb here and say that if you’re not using some form of containerization or a virtual machine tool, your progress as a web developer will suffer.\n\nOf course, this isn’t necessarily true for everyone, but there are many benefits to using a container-based development environment. Here are a few choice solutions.\n\n#### 48\\. Docker\n\nFor many, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is *the* container-based development environment of choice. The open source platform isn’t all about containers, but this is an oft-mentioned reason for using it.\n\n![The Docker logo.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/docker.png)\n\nThe Docker logo.\n\nOn the frontend, it’s a simple process: click a button and get a virtual sandboxed development environment. Of course, anything that seems simple up top is deep underneath. Docker combines a User Interface (UI), CLI, and API with a security provision to put rapid deployment into your hands.\n\nFor many developers, Docker is going to be central to creating new apps. Web developers — WordPress devs in particular — have a pick of tools for the job. Local by Flywheel and DevKinsta are leading platforms.\n\n![The DevKinsta app is powered by Docker.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devkinsta.png)\n\nDocker powers the DevKinsta app.\n\n**Note:** We’ve recently launched DevKinsta — a local development tool to help you spin up new WordPress sites. You can also deploy the sites to your Kinsta account with a single click.\n\nDocker also integrates with many tools — and several of them will be in your workflow already. Apps such as GitHub, VS Code, and more can connect with Docker and offer smooth integration.\n\nOn the whole, Docker could take up a whole series of articles on what it contains. Despite this, none of it may be necessary. The likelihood is that you’re using Docker daily, and you already know how awesome it is!\n\n#### 49\\. LXD\n\nIn simple terms, [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) is a container manager for Linux distros. It’s image-based and comes with several pre-built images for Linux. Using an LXD gives you peace of mind that you’ll be developing on the same default end-user OS.\n\n![The LXD website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lxd-containers.png)\n\nThe LXD logo.\n\nIt was founded by [Ubuntu developers Canonical](https://canonical.com/), and of course, maintains an open source structure. You’re able to create secure environments using unprivileged containers, control resource usage using many resources, and even manage networks.\n\nLXD is also scalable, which means you can run thousands of compute nodes or keep things simple. For cloud-based applications, LXD [integrates with OpenNebula](https://opennebula.io/get-your-hands-on-v-5-8-edge/) — the latter has official drivers to manage LXD instances.\n\nBy default, many containerization tools use Ubuntu as the standard virtual environment. Even so, LXD is optimized to run the distro. If it isn’t something you’ve tried before, it’s worth the time to run through a test workspace. You could find that it suits specific workflows or client projects better than the competition.\n\n### Image Optimization Tools\n\nAssets (or media, or whatever your preferred name is) are abundant across the web. There are whole online cultures dedicated and based around images. As such, making your web development projects perform well despite the number of images used is critical.\n\nHere are some of the most popular and excellent [image optimization](https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/) tools available.\n\n#### 50\\. ShortPixel\n\n![The ShortPixel website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shortpixel.png)\n\nThe ShortPixel website.\n\nThere are many image optimization apps available, but [ShortPixel](http://shortpixel.com/) has a subjectively robust algorithm. It’s able to crush image file sizes without affecting quality. If we’re picky, we’d suggest that because the default setting is the highest compression available, there’s nowhere else to go if your image isn’t squashed enough. Still, this isn’t a significant criticism.\n\nShortPixel has tons of functionality under the hood. There are three levels of compression, a [great PDF optimizer](https://shortpixel.com/online-pdf-compressor), and even a GIF compressor. The latter is something you don’t find in many other tools, so it’s a welcome addition to the product line.\n\nThe whole interface is accessible, too: You drag and drop images onto the uploader and wait for ShortPixel to work its magic. Once your images are processed, you can download them as a batch or select individual images for download:\n\n![Downloading images from ShortPixel.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shortpixel-downloader.png)\n\nDownloading images from ShortPixel.\n\nThe [ShortPixel API tools](https://shortpixel.com/api-tools) are robust too. You’ll find separate APIs for reducing online and offline images, comprehensive PHP and .NET client libraries, a JavaScript-based adaptive engine, and more.\n\nWe’d suggest that ShortPixel is a developer’s tool, as it’s great for connecting your website or app. We’d also say it would overtake your TinyPNG addiction in a snap, especially if you wanted to use it as part of a larger workflow.\n\n#### 51\\. TinyPNG\n\nIt’s time for everyone’s favorite image optimization tool — [TinyPNG](http://tinypng.com/). You can also bundle [TinyJPG](http://tinyjpg.com/) into this entry, although both tools work with the same image formats.\n\n![The TinyPNG website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tinypng.png)\n\nThe TinyPNG website.\n\nYou’ll find that TinyPNG hasn’t changed much over the years. It’s still a simple drag-and-drop tool for optimizing your images. There aren’t any bells or whistles, and there isn’t an extensive set of file formats. Still, what TinyPNG _does_ offer is supreme usability and a bunch of integrations with other tools.\n\nFor example, there’s a [Photoshop plugin](https://tinypng.com/photoshop) and — for more fine-grained applications — a [functional developer API](https://tinypng.com/developers). Even Python users can get in on the act, as the API supports this language too. There have been [several plugins](https://tinypng.com/third-party) created using the API for lots of third-party tools too.\n\nWe’re not suggesting that TinyPNG has a monopoly on the image optimization market, but it’s often the first choice for many users. Taking an image and dropping it into the uploader takes seconds, and when you get a 99.9% perfect representation of your image back, it’s easy to trust.\n\n### Website Testing Tools\n\nWe talked earlier about testing your API and core site code, though this misses your website’s performance. Here are a few tools we love that could also help you to analyze how your sites perform.\n\n#### 52\\. Responsively\n\n![The Responsively app.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/responsively.png)\n\nThe Responsively app.\n\nIf you’ve ever been overwhelmed by the number of media queries you need to perform and perfect in your app, [check out Responsively](https://responsively.app/). It’s an open source frontend tool to help you develop sites as per the various viewports of your chosen devices.\n\n![Viewing different devices in Responsively.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/responsively-viewports.png)\n\nViewing different devices in Responsively.\n\nThe great thing about this is how you can compare layouts side by side. It gives you a solid chance of upping your consistency between devices. Each device is precise, and there are many to choose from, which is excellent if your site targets specific devices.\n\nYou can also add the dedicated browser extensions for [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/responsively-helper), [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/responsively-helper/ooiejjgflcgkbbehheengalibfehaojn), and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsively-helper/jhphiidjkooiaollfiknkokgodbaddcj) to send pages to the Responsively browser. From here, you can crack open the built-in dev tools and get to work.\n\n![The Responsively inspector.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/responsively-inspector.png)\n\nThe Responsively inspector.\n\nThere are tons of other features, such as screenshot functionality, hot-loading support, and more to help you develop. It’s hard to argue with the tagline that Responsively is the “web developer’s browser.” It may end up being a core component of your workflow.\n\n#### 53\\. Google Lighthouse\n\nFor many, Google’s [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) is a valuable tool for discovering how a website performs and where you can enhance the loading speed.\n\n![Google’s PageSpeed Insights.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pagespeed-insights.png)\n\nGoogle’s PageSpeed Insights.\n\nThat said, some of the software under the hood is more interesting to look into in-depth. It could also be a better fit for your needs. [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) can be run against any webpage, and provides audits and reports for page performance, SEO, Progressive Web Apps (PWA), etc.\n\nThe primary ways to run Google Lighthouse are from the command line, using Chrome’s DevTools, or as a Node module. If you use the PageSpeed Insights interface, Lighthouse generates some of the scores and providers further insights.\n\nIt’s worth noting that on the surface, Google Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights appear similar. But PageSpeed Insights uses lab-based data combined with real-world user data. Lighthouse’suse’s analysis disregards user data and measures more elements of your website.\n\nIn our opinion, it’s worth running both PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse, especially if your client’s goal is to hit the top of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). In any case, it’s a solid tool to have to hand, and it could even supplant PageSpeed Insights as your performance tool of choice.\n\n#### 54\\. Cypress\n\nEnd-to-end testing is something that isn’t a joyful experience for many developers. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has chosen this hill to die on — it’s a no-fuss solution that bucks the trend for end-to-end testing and produces something stellar.\n\n![The Cypress homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cypress.png)\n\nThe Cypress homepage.\n\nWhile most end-to-end testing tools are based on [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), Cypress goes in a different direction. It means the issues users find with Selenium-based testers aren’t present here. In fact, the developers want to make setting up, writing, and running tests a breeze.\n\nTo do this, they built the architecture from scratch and focused on end-to-end testing to the exclusion of other forms. To help performance, Cypress runs in the same run loop as your program, rather than executing remote commands through the network.\n\nBecause the test code runs in the browser, there are no driver or language bindings to consider. Even so, you’re able to compile down to JavaScript before running tests.\n\nIf you’re a Quality Assurance (QA) engineer or a developer who wants your end-to-end testing to have native access to your work, Cypress should command your attention. The best part is there’s a [full-featured free tier](https://www.cypress.io/pricing) too!\n\n### 55\\. Stack Overflow and Search Engines\n\nFor one moment, allow us to stretch the boundaries of what’s considered a web development tool. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is well-known anyone with even a passing knowledge of web development:\n\n![The Stack Overflow website.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stack-overflow.png)\n\nThe Stack Overflow website.\n\nIt’s a question-and-answer site focused on programming, and it’s part of the [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) network that covers all manner of other subjects:\n\n![One of many niche sites in the Stack Exchange network.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stack-exchange.png)\n\nOne of many niche sites in the Stack Exchange network.\n\nIt’s known as a go-to resource for thousands of developers, and despite some [controversy over its community](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52), traffic is still substantial. We’d venture to say that Stack, along with your search engine of choice, represents a flexible web development tool for learning and improving your skills.\n\nFor example, you’ll likely head to Stack Overflow when encountering a development roadblock relating to code. Likewise, when an error pops up that you’re unsure how to resolve, pasting it into a search engine is the fastest way to find the answer you need.\n\nGiven that [90% of surveyed users](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-what-do-you-do-when-you-get-stuck) go to Stack Overflow to solve problems, it’s likely that everyone will use the tool. However, for beginners — or even if you can’t articulate your problem — search engines will arguably be a little friendlier.\n\n### Web Development References\n\nIf you’re a developer who subscribes to the “RTFM” ethos, you won’t need any convincing over the following few entries. In contrast, if you like to wade into a problem and figure it out, know that there have been countless developers before you who have likely found an answer.\n\nGiven this, look at the following few web development tools, all based on web reference materials.\n\n#### 56\\. MDN Web Docs\n\nWay back in the early days of the net, there was a [site called Webmonkey](https://gawker.com/187550/exclusive-leak-editor-says-lycos-will-shutter-webmonkey) run by Lycos and aimed to teach web development and programming to new users. The spirit of that website lives on in Mozilla’s [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Webmoney shut down in 2004, and MDN Web Docs arrived in 2005, so there’s a natural dovetail between the two.\n\n![The MDN Web Docs homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mdn-web-docs.png)\n\nThe MDN Web Docs homepage.\n\nIt’s a collection of resources to help teach you programming for the web in some cases, and Mozilla-specific products in others. The content is divided into two broad categories: technologies and reference guides. You’re shown several tutorials based on your existing ability and experience, a dedicated reference guide, and some further resources for the former.\n\nThe guides are all related to specific niches and industries within the development industry. For example, the [Web Development reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference) acts as a “cornerstone” page for additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript guides.\n\n![MDN Web Docs JavaScript page.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mdn-javascript.png)\n\nMDN Web Docs JavaScript page.\n\nThere are also broad looks at various industries, such as game development and what it takes to start in the field:\n\n![The MDN guide on game development.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mdn-game-development.png)\n\nMDN Web Doc’s guide on game development.\n\nMDN Web Docs is essential reading for a beginner web developer, and it also offers more than enough value for an expert. If there is any site that deserves a browser bookmark, this is it!\n\n#### 57\\. DevDocs — API Documentation Browser\n\nIn the past, you’d save all the manuals for the products you buy in a dusty drawer or cupboard. As life has become more digital, those paper manuals have given way to PDF downloads from each manufacturer’s website.\n\nThrough this, we now have websites that collect the digital versions of manuals in curated libraries. It lets you find what you need from one repository. As such, it stands to reason that one would exist for web development topics too.\n\nIn short, [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io/) is a library of documentation for APIs, and it’s something we think will be valuable for almost all developers:\n\n![The DevDocs homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devdocs.png)\n\nThe DevDocs homepage.\n\nBefore you look through the library, you’ll want to enable your desired API documentation. You do this from the **Preferences** screen:\n\n![The DevDocs Preferences screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devdocs-preferences.png)\n\nThe DevDocs Preferences screen.\n\nOnce done, you’ll be able to access the relevant documentation from a dedicated tree menu:\n\n![The WordPress API screen.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devdocs-wordpress.png)\n\nThe WordPress API screen.\n\nIt’s a simple solution to an inefficient problem in that you have multiple API references in one place. DevDocs is another site that deserves a bookmark, and it’s a shame there’s not a desktop app available for even quicker reference.\n\n#### 58\\. CSS-Tricks\n\nChris Coyier is a name many web developers will know. We’d bet that you’re already familiar with the website he founded — [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/). As the name suggests, it’s a website dedicated to frontend coding, specifically CSS, and how to get better.\n\n![The CSS-Tricks homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/css-tricks.png)\n\nThe CSS-Tricks homepage.\n\nAs the [About page notes](https://css-tricks.com/about/), for the first few years, CSS was the predominant topic. Since then, though, HTML, JavaScript, WordPress, and more have become just as important and frequently discussed. The result is a site focused on frontend development, with a raft of articles, videos, and guides to inspire you.\n\n![The blogroll for CSS-Tricks.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/css-tricks-articles.png)\n\nThe blogroll for CSS-Tricks.\n\nOne simple yet valuable element is the [CSS Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/), which outlines the selectors and properties within CSS. It’s a great reference source if you need to get up to speed with certain aspects of the language.\n\n![The CSS-Tricks Almanac.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/css-tricks-almanac.png)\n\nThe CSS-Tricks Almanac.\n\nWhile there are reference-like aspects of CSS-Tricks, it’s not a reference resource _per se_. Still, it should be a regular haunt for you, whether that’s through an RSS feed or another solution. The content is of high quality and can challenge you in ways you hadn’t thought of before. At the very least, [subscribe to the newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/246-communication-is-key/) and wait for CSS-Tricks to hit your inbox.\n\nImagine that you could take the excellent parts from social media, web development, and Stack Overflow, and then create one site that merges them. The [DEV Community](http://dev.to/) might be the result.\n\n![The DEV Community homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dev-community.png)\n\nThe DEV Community homepage.\n\nIt’s a blogging platform, but also a way to find the answers to development questions. You select tags and people to follow, and your newsfeed becomes an automated and curated timeline of posts and insights:\n\n![The DEV Community timeline for the JavaScript tag.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dev-community-timeline.png)\n\nThe DEV Community timeline for the JavaScript tag.\n\nIt’s a fair point to suggest that this is information that you can find everywhere — if you’re willing to find it. The plus point of the DEV Community is that it’s here, and it’s a directed collation of development subjects. Think of it as a developer convention track, rather than overhearing and butting into a related conversation at the bus stop.\n\nIt’s another site that will do well within your RSS feed, or as a digest in your inbox. As such, it’s also a “sleeper” resource in that you’ll head here a lot without realizing it.\n\n#### 60\\. Can I use…\n\nYou could argue [Jeeves started the trend](http://ask.com/) of asking the internet questions to find information. He was replaced fast by various search algorithms, though the question-based search is still a reliable way to find what you need.\n\n*[Can I use…](https://caniuse.com/)* is the frontend developer’s answer to “_Is there an Ask Jeeves for CSS?_”\n\n![The Can I use… homepage.](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/can-i-use.png)\n\nThe Can I use… homepage.\n\nThe premise is simple: you type the CSS selector or property into the search field, and the database returns whether you can use it for creating websites. You’re not restricted to CSS either. JavaScript and HTML are also supported:\n\n![Searching for an HTML element in Can I use…](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/can-i-use-html.png)\n\nSearching for an HTML element in Can I use…\n\nIt’s a frontend language database, so it won’t look to return results for PHP, Python, or other server-side languages. Even so, _Can I use…_ is an immense and valuable tool that will help you when it comes to accessibility and designing for multiple devices.\n\nIt’s a simple proposition to pull up a specific element and see at a glance whether your target browser supports it:\n\n![The browser support table in Can I use…](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/can-i-use-element-detail.png)\n\nThe browser support table in _Can I use…_\n\nIf you look closer, you can also find statistics such as the release date for the element and a usage percentage:\n\n![Information for a specific element in Can I use…](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/can-i-use-element-information.png)\n\nInformation for a specific element in Can I use…\n\nOn the whole, _Can I use…_ might not get regular use.

With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically \"developed\" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.\n\n\u003e When you photograph people in color, you photograph their clothes. But when you photograph people in Black and white, you photograph their souls! ― Ted Grant\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

These people write the code that gets a website working and visible on the world wide web.\n\nThe primary task of a web developer is to write code, which is a set of commands and instructions written in a particular programming language. Code makes up everything in the online world, from your computer’s operating system to the backend of a website you visit.\n\nTake a look at Wikipedia’s homepage and imagine what it might take to create even such a simple website. A web developer set up the layout of this page, from the sidebar to the tables to the top bar. They had to set up scripts to take blurbs from the featured articles and request dynamic content from the site.\n\nA database stores these articles and their revisions, also set up by a developer.\n\nWikipedia homepage\n\nIt takes a ton of work, but everything comes together piece by piece to create a functional website.\n\nWith the exponential rise of the internet, programmers are in high demand and have a great job outlook. Everyone wants to have their website, and web developers are here to help them make it.\n\n[Want to work in web development... but no idea where to start? 😅 This post has the best online learning platforms, web development tools, and career info you’ll need ⬇️Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinsta.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-become-a-web-developer%2F\u0026via=kinsta\u0026text=Want+to+work+in+web+development...+but+no+idea+where+to+start%3F+%F0%9F%98%85+This+post+has+the+best+online+learning+platforms%2C+web+development+tools%2C+and+career+info+you%E2%80%99ll+need+%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F\u0026hashtags=WebDev%2CTechCareers)\n\n## What Does a Web Developer Do?\n\nWondering what exactly your daily tasks are? Here’s the general job description for a web developer:\n\n-   Use code to create websites and prototypes\n\n-   Design a visually appealing layout for a website (either from scratch or with the help of a [web designer](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/))\n\n-   Maintain active websites by [cleaning up code](https://kinsta.com/blog/code-review-tools/) and debugging errors\n\n-   Create a database [using SQL](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/)\n\n-   Work with clients to decide on project scope and figure out the fine details of website features and design\n\nThere are dozens of ways you can specialize, which will change your job description a fair bit. For instance, you could choose to work in frontend or backend technologies, or you could [become a systems administrator](https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/) responsible for keeping servers up and running.\n\nBut in general, these are the most basic tasks you’ll be responsible for.\n\n## Why Become a Web Developer?\n\nWhile it may not be for everyone, web development has a shallow barrier to entry and is one of the most accessible jobs you can pick up. Despite this, it pays reasonably well, and web developers are always in demand.\n\nThat’s not to say that the work isn’t often challenging, but the fundamentals are very quickly self-taught (and many developers like the challenge!).\n\nBreaking into the ever-growing tech industry is always a good choice long-term. If you’re willing and able to pursue [popular coding languages](https://kinsta.com/blog/scripting-languages/) — and in web development, there’s always a hot new language employers are scrambling to hire for — you’re almost guaranteed a steady job.\n\nPopular coding languages between 2020–21\n\nFinally, web development is a flexible job. Your career may be spent [doing freelance work](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-tools-for-freelancers/) or at a [company with a salary](https://kinsta.com/developer-roles/development-at-kinsta/). The tasks you do and the skills or languages you focus on are up to you.\n\nYou’ll need to try out programming before you can say if it’s right for you, but if you put in the work to try beginner coding and find that it makes sense, then you may make a good web developer.\n\n### Web Developer Salary and Demand\n\nIf you’re considering becoming a web developer, it’s good to know what sort of salary you can expect and how easy it will be to get a job.\n\nYou can check our write-ups on [the average web developer salary](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/), plus [PHP developers](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-developer-salary/) and [WordPress developers](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/).\n\nBut the consensus is that the average developer makes $60k–75k/year.\n\nAverage developer base salary in June 2021\n\nOf course, the pay will depend on your experience level, the languages and technologies you pursue, and whether you freelance or work a steady job. But it’s a reasonable estimate to start with.\n\nAs for demand, the US Bureau of Labor predicts that [demand for web designers and developers will grow 8%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6) from 2019–29. For reference, that’s double what most occupations on average are projected to grow.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor statistics on increases in employment opportunities for web developers\n\nSome web developer jobs are more competitive than others — positions like frontend developer, which are far easier to pick up, may pay less well and be more laborious to find a job for — but the outlook is still outstanding.\n\n## How Hard Is It to Become a Web Developer?\n\nWeb development is one of the most straightforward jobs to get into — if you can figure out programming. Not all jobs are for everyone, and there will be those who may struggle to wrap their heads around code.\n\nFor some people, becoming a web developer will be a breeze. For others, it may never quite click with you. But for most people, a little dedication and a lot of practice will go a long way.\n\nThe process of becoming a web developer is much less convoluted than other jobs, and there are [more paths available](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/) to get you on the right track. It’s also a much more flexible, varied job with lots of different specializations. So whatever your learning style or skills you’re suited for, there’s something for you.\n\nMastering web development will take ongoing work and dedication, and it’s a job that offers a challenge and requires problem-solving skills. It’s easy to learn the basics, but expect to encounter frustrating yet solvable problems along the way.\n\n### Web Development Requirements\n\nCurious about what you’ll need to become a web developer? The exact requirements depend on where you’re specializing. For instance, a backend developer should generally create and edit a database, but you cannot expect the same of a frontend developer.\n\nIn addition, the programming languages and frameworks you know will distinguish you as a specific type of developer.\n\nStill, here are some skills and knowledge you’ll need, regardless of specialization, before you can call yourself a web developer:\n\n-   Proficiency in at least one web language. Depending on your position, you will likely need to learn more.\n\n-   Knowledge in other related skills ([web frameworks](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/), libraries, [Git](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/), etc.).\n\n-   Problem-solving skills are required to work with and debug code.\n\n-   Attentive to details to stop bugs from happening in the first place.\n\n-   Communication and team skills are essential to work with other developers, clients, designers, and testers.\n\n-   A degree of independence and being able to problem-solve on your own.\n\n-   Self-motivated learning is another necessary skill for success.\n\n-   Familiarity with [popular web development tools](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/) is valuable.\n\n### Do You Need a Degree to Become a Web Developer?\n\nMany jobs request that applicants have an associate’s degree in computer science or a similar field. Other positions may ask for a bachelor’s degree or just certification from an online course.\n\nHowever, you do not strictly need a college degree to get a job. Experience and a [complete portfolio](https://kinsta.com/blog/portfolio-website/) are often far more valuable. More and more job listings are skipping out on requiring a degree and opting to ask for proof of experience.\n\nAs this is a highly technical field with plenty of room for self-teaching, it’s more important that you know how to do the job than that you’re certified to do it. That said, a degree will make it simpler from the start.\n\nSelf-taught developers may find difficulty landing their first job with neither experience nor a degree. You’ll likely need to fill your portfolio with self-made projects first or turn to freelance to build up some job history.\n\nIf you don’t want a formal college degree, online certifications like those offered by coding bootcamps can be a suitable replacement.\n\n### Types of Web Developers\n\nWeb development is a highly specialized career. You’ll rarely find a person who describes themselves simply as a “web developer.” Depending on what you do, which part of the website you focus on, and what technologies you work with, you can choose from a wide array of job titles.\n\n-   **Frontend developer:** A widespread choice as the skills are easy to pick up, frontend/client-side developers work on the front-facing website. Languages of choice are [HTML](https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/), CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap and jQuery are also popular technologies.\n\n-   **Backend developer:** These developers work with technologies like the server and database. No backend developer is the same, as there are dozens of backend programming languages. Common choices are Java, Ruby, [PHP](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/), Python, and [MySQL](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/).\n\n-   **Full-stack developer:** A combination of frontend and backend developers. They know enough languages to get by on the server and client sides.\n\nThese are the main three, but you can specialize further by becoming a web engineer, security expert, [WordPress developer](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/), mobile web developer, web application developer, and more.\n\n## Steps to Becoming a Web Developer\n\nYou can take various paths to become a web developer, and your own experience will present unique challenges. But generally, most web development careers follow a similar form.\n\nFirst, you need to choose how you’ll learn development. Will you be going to college? What sort of degree are you pursuing? An associate’s or bachelor’s degree related in some way to computer science is best.\n\nIf you’re not going to college, will you try to get certified? Certification or not, will you take a paid or free online course? Or are you going all-in to teach yourself using [only online resources](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/)?\n\nAfter you’ve decided that, you’ll need to pick a specialization (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.). You can put this off as you experiment with different aspects of web development, but you need to choose before pursuing a narrowed study.\n\nNext, is what [programming languages](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/) and technologies do you want to learn?\n\nAll this may come in a different order. You may choose to specialize or go in already knowing what languages you want to learn and then select a course accordingly.\n\n### Want to know how we increased our traffic over 1000%?\n\nJoin 20,000+ others who get our weekly newsletter with insider WordPress tips!\n\n[Subscribe Now](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer/#newsletter)\n\nAfter you’ve picked up some web development skills, you’ll need to get some projects under your belt for your portfolio.

A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for both features there.\n\nHiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by [New Zealanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips), walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran and in the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, are referred to as [backpacking](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(wilderness)\u003e).\n\n## Long Distance Hiking\n\nFrequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the National Trail System in the USA and The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours are often made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of mountain huts.\n\nIn the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), trail (USA), The Grande Randonnée (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the Appalachian Trail in the USA and the Pennine Way in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury. Hiking times can be estimated by Naismith's rule or Tobler's hiking function.\n\n## Equipment\n\nThe equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of \"Ten Essentials\" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.\n\n\u003e Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. ― Cindy Ross\n\nProponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nNatural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.\n\nHuman waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.

Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.\n\n\u003e TipThis guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.\n\nThis is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.\n\nEvery chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. **You can learn most of React by reading the \"Main Concepts\" guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.** For example, [\"Introducing JSX\"](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is the next chapter after this one.\n\n# Knowledge Level Assumptions\n\nReact is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. **If you don't feel very confident, we recommend **[**going through a JavaScript tutorial**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)** to check your knowledge level** and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.\n\n\u003e NoteThis guide occasionally uses some newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should get you most of the way.\n\n# **Introducing JSX**\n\n# Consider this variable declaration:\n\nThis funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.\n\nIt is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.\n\nJSX produces React \"elements\". We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html). Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.\n\n# Why JSX?\n\nReact embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.\n\nInstead of artificially separating *technologies* by putting markup and logic in separate files, React [separates *concerns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) with loosely coupled units called \"components\" that contain both. We will come back to components in a [further section](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), but if you're not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) might convince you otherwise.\n\nReact [doesn't require](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get started!\n\n# Embedding Expressions in JSX\n\nIn the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:\n\nYou can put any valid [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.\n\nIn the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an \\\u003ch1\u003e element.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"embedding-expressions-jsx\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZgm?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZgm\"\u003e\n  embedding-expressions-jsx\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn't required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of [automatic semicolon insertion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283).\n\n# JSX is an Expression Too\n\nAfter compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.\n\nThis means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:\n\n# Specifying Attributes with JSX\n\nYou may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:\n\nYou may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:\n\nDon't put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.\n\n\u003e Warning:Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.\n\n# Specifying Children with JSX\n\nIf a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with /\u003e, like XML:\n\nJSX tags may contain children:\n\n# JSX Prevents Injection Attacks\n\nIt is safe to embed user input in JSX:\n\nBy default, React DOM [escapes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html) any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that's not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent [XSS (cross-site-scripting)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.\n\n# JSX Represents Objects\n\nBabel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.\n\nThese two examples are identical:\n\nReact.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:\n\nThese objects are called \"React elements\". You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.\n\nWe will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).\n\n\u003e Tip:We recommend using the \"Babel\" language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.\n\n# **Rendering Elements**\n\n# Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.\n\nAn element describes what you want to see on the screen:\n\nconst element = \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, world\\\u003c/h1\u003e;\n\nUnlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.\n\n\u003e Note:One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of \"components\". We will introduce components in the next section. Elements are what components are \"made of\", and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.\n\n# Rendering an Element into the DOM\n\nLet's say there is a \\\u003cdiv\u003e somewhere in your HTML file:\n\nWe call this a \"root\" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.\n\nApplications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.\n\nTo render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e):\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/render-an-element)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"rendering-elements\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWeb?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWeb\"\u003e\n  rendering-elements\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt displays \"Hello, world\" on the page.\n\n# Updating the Rendered Element\n\nReact elements are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.\n\nWith our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e).\n\nConsider this ticking clock example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"updating-rendered-elements\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvNy?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvNy\"\u003e\n  updating-rendered-elements\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt calls \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e) every second from a \\[setInterval()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval\u003e) callback.\n\n\u003e Note:In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.We recommend that you don't skip topics because they build on each other.\n\n# React Only Updates What's Necessary\n\nReact DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.\n\nYou can verify by inspecting the [last example](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element) with the browser tools:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif)\n\nEven though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.\n\nIn our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.\n\n# **Components and Props**\n\n# Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a [detailed component API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).\n\nConceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called \"props\") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.\n\n# Function and Class Components\n\nThe simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:\n\nThis function is a valid React component because it accepts a single \"props\" (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components \"function components\" because they are literally JavaScript functions.\n\nYou can also use an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to define a component:\n\nThe above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.\n\nFunction and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss in the [next sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).\n\n# Rendering a Component\n\nPreviously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:\n\nHowever, elements can also represent user-defined components:\n\nWhen React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object \"props\".\n\nFor example, this code renders \"Hello, Sara\" on the page:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/rendering-a-component)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"rendering-component\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/QWgwpjd?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nLet's recap what happens in this example:\n\n1.  We call ReactDOM.render() with the \\\u003cWelcome name=\"Sara\" /\u003e element.\n\n2.  React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.\n\n3.  Our Welcome component returns a \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, Sara\\\u003c/h1\u003e element as the result.\n\n4.  React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, Sara\\\u003c/h1\u003e.\n\n\u003e Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example,\n\n# Composing Components\n\nComponents can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.\n\nFor example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/composing-components)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/LYLEWNq?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTypically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.\n\n# Extracting Components\n\nDon't be afraid to split components into smaller components.\n\nFor example, consider this Comment component:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/PojwpzP?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.\n\nThis component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let's extract a few components from it.\n\nFirst, we will extract Avatar:\n\nThe Avatar doesn't need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.\n\nWe recommend naming props from the component's own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.\n\nWe can now simplify Comment a tiny bit:\n\nNext, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user's name:\n\nfunction UserInfo(props) { return ( \\\u003cdiv className=\"UserInfo\"\u003e \\\u003cAvatar user={props.user} /\u003e \\\u003cdiv className=\"UserInfo-name\"\u003e {props.user.name} \\\u003c/div\u003e \\\u003c/div\u003e ); }\n\nThis lets us simplify Comment even further:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components-continued)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvzV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nExtracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.\n\n# Props are Read-Only\n\nWhether you declare a component [as a function or a class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:\n\nSuch functions are called [\"pure\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.\n\nIn contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:\n\nReact is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:\n\n**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**\n\nOf course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), we will introduce a new concept of \"state\". State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.\n\n# **State and Lifecycle**\n\n# This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a [detailed component API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).\n\nConsider the ticking clock example from [one of the previous sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#updating-the-rendered-element). In [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom), we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwoJZk?editors=0010)\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.\n\nWe can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/dpdoYR?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/powvegw?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nHowever, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.\n\nIdeally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:\n\nTo implement this, we need to add \"state\" to the Clock component.\n\nState is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.\n\n# Converting a Function to a Class\n\nYou can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:\n\n1.  Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), with the same name, that extends React.Component.\n\n2.  Add a single empty method to it called render().\n\n3.  Move the body of the function into the render() method.\n\n4.  Replace props with this.props in the render() body.\n\n5.  Delete the remaining empty function declaration.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/zKRGpo?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvJV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nClock is now defined as a class rather than a function.\n\nThe render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render \\\u003cClock /\u003e into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.\n\n# Adding Local State to a Class\n\nWe will move the date from props to state in three steps:\n\n1.  Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method:\n\n\u003c!----\u003e\n\n1.  Add a [class constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor) that assigns the initial this.state:\n\nNote how we pass props to the base constructor:\n\nClass components should always call the base constructor with props.\n\n1.  Remove the date prop from the \\\u003cClock /\u003e element:\n\nWe will later add the timer code back to the component itself.\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/KgQpJd?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZbV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nNext, we'll make the Clock set up its own timer and update itself every second.\n\n# Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class\n\nIn applications with many components, it's very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.\n\nWe want to [set up a timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called \"mounting\" in React.\n\nWe also want to [clear that timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval) whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called \"unmounting\" in React.\n\nWe can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:\n\nThese methods are called \"lifecycle methods\".\n\nThe componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:\n\nNote how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID).\n\nWhile this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn't participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).\n\nWe will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method:\n\nFinally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock component will run every second.\n\nIt will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component local state:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/amqdNA?editors=0010)\n\nNow the clock ticks every second.\n\nLet's quickly recap what's going on and the order in which the methods are called:\n\n1.  When \\\u003cClock /\u003e is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor of the Clock component. Since Clock needs to display the current time, it initializes this.state with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.\n\n2.  React then calls the Clock component's render() method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the Clock's render output.\n\n3.  When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle method. Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component's tick() method once a second.\n\n4.  Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render() method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.\n\n5.  If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.\n\n# Using State Correctly\n\nThere are three things you should know about setState().\n\n# Do Not Modify State Directly\n\nFor example, this will not re-render a component:\n\nInstead, use setState():\n\nThe only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.\n\n# State Updates May Be Asynchronous\n\nReact may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.\n\nBecause this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\nFor example, this code may fail to update the counter:\n\nTo fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:\n\nWe used an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) above, but it also works with regular functions:\n\n# State Updates are Merged\n\nWhen you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.\n\nFor example, your state may contain several independent variables:\n\nThen you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:\n\nThe merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments.\n\n# The Data Flows Down\n\nNeither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn't care whether it is defined as a function or a class.\n\nThis is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.\n\nA component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:\n\nThe FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props and wouldn't know whether it came from the Clock's state, from the Clock's props, or was typed by hand:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/zKRqNB?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/GREgWEp?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis is commonly called a \"top-down\" or \"unidirectional\" data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components \"below\" them in the tree.\n\nIf you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component's state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.\n\nTo show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three \\\u003cClock\u003es:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/vXdGmd?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/YzQPZQK?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nEach Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently.\n\nIn React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.\n\n# **Handling Events**\n\n# Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:\n\n-   React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.\n\n-   With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.\n\nFor example, the HTML:\n\nis slightly different in React:\n\nAnother difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:\n\nIn React, this could instead be:\n\nHere, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/), so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events. See the \\[SyntheticEvent]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/events.html\u003e) reference guide to learn more.\n\nWhen using React, you generally don't need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.\n\nWhen you define a component using an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/xEmzGg?editors=0010)\n\nYou have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not [bound](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.\n\nThis is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of [how functions work in JavaScript](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/understanding-javascript-function-prototype-bind/). Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.\n\nIf calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental [public class fields syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/), you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:\n\nThis syntax is enabled by default in [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).\n\nIf you aren't using class fields syntax, you can use an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) in the callback:\n\nThe problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.\n\n# Passing Arguments to Event Handlers\n\nInside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:\n\n\\\u003cbutton onClick={(e) =\u003e this.deleteRow(id, e)}\u003eDelete Row\\\u003c/button\u003e\\\u003cbutton onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}\u003eDelete Row\\\u003c/button\u003e\n\nThe above two lines are equivalent, and use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and \\[Function.prototype.bind]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind\u003e) respectively.\n\nIn both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.\n\n# **Conditional Rendering**\n\n# In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.\n\nConditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like \\[if]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else\u003e) or the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.\n\nConsider these two components:\n\nWe'll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZpVxNq?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWmJ?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop.\n\n# Element Variables\n\nYou can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn't change.\n\nConsider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons:\n\nIn the example below, we will create a [stateful component](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class) called LoginControl.\n\nIt will render either \\\u003cLoginButton /\u003e or \\\u003cLogoutButton /\u003e depending on its current state. It will also render a \\\u003cGreeting /\u003e from the previous example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/QKzAgB?editors=0010)\n\nWhile declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below.\n\n# Inline If with Logical \u0026\u0026 Operator\n\nYou may [embed expressions in JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical \u0026\u0026 operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ozJddz?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/VwWYppo?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt works because in JavaScript, true \u0026\u0026 expression always evaluates to expression, and false \u0026\u0026 expression always evaluates to false.\n\nTherefore, if the condition is true, the element right after \u0026\u0026 will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it.\n\nNote that returning a falsy expression will still cause the element after \u0026\u0026 to be skipped but will return the falsy expression. In the example below, \\\u003cdiv\u003e0\\\u003c/div\u003e will be returned by the render method.\n\n# Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator\n\nAnother method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator \\[condition ? true : false]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\u003e).\n\nIn the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text.\n\nIt can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what's going on:\n\nJust like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).\n\n# Preventing Component from Rendering\n\nIn rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.\n\nIn the example below, the \\\u003cWarningBanner /\u003e is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/Xjoqwm?editors=0010)\n\nReturning null from a component's render method does not affect the firing of the component's lifecycle methods. For instance componentDidUpdate will still be called.\n\n# **Lists and Keys**\n\n# First, let's review how you transform lists in JavaScript.\n\nGiven the code below, we use the \\[map()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\u003e) function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:\n\nThis code logs \\[2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.\n\nIn React, transforming arrays into lists of [elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) is nearly identical.\n\n# Rendering Multiple Components\n\nYou can build collections of elements and [include them in JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) using curly braces {}.\n\nBelow, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript \\[map()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\u003e) function. We return a \\\u003cli\u003e element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:\n\nWe include the entire listItems array inside a \\\u003cul\u003e element, and [render it to the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom):\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/GjPyQr?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvvr?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.\n\n# Basic List Component\n\nUsually you would render lists inside a [component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).\n\nWe can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of numbers and outputs a list of elements.\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A \"key\" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We'll discuss why it's important in the next section.\n\nLet's assign a key to our list items inside numbers.map() and fix the missing key issue.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/jrXYRR?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/yLXyMMP?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Keys\n\nKeys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:\n\nThe best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:\n\nWhen you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:\n\nWe don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny's article for an [in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318). If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.\n\nHere is an [in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children) if you're interested in learning more.\n\n# Extracting Components with Keys\n\nKeys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.\n\nFor example, if you [extract](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components) a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the \\\u003cListItem /\u003e elements in the array rather than on the \\\u003cli\u003e element in the ListItem itself.\n\n**Example: Incorrect Key Usage**\n\n**Example: Correct Key Usage**\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZXeOGM?editors=0010)\n\nA good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.\n\n# Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings\n\nKeys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don't need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/NRZYGN?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWWy?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nKeys serve as a hint to React but they don't get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:\n\nWith the example above, the Post component can read props.id, but not props.key.\n\n# Embedding map() in JSX\n\nIn the examples above we declared a separate listItems variable and included it in JSX:\n\nJSX allows [embedding any expression](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) in curly braces so we could inline the map() result:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/BLvYrB?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/JjJoWEw?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).\n\n# **Forms**\n\n# HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:\n\nThis form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it's convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called \"controlled components\".\n\n# Controlled Components\n\nIn HTML, form elements such as \\\u003cinput\u003e, \\\u003ctextarea\u003e, and \\\u003cselect\u003e typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with \\[setState()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate\u003e).\n\nWe can combine the two by making the React state be the \"single source of truth\". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a \"controlled component\".\n\nFor example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/VmmPgp?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/rNwayjv?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSince the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.\n\nWith a controlled component, the input's value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.\n\n# The textarea Tag\n\nIn HTML, a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e element defines its text by its children:\n\nIn React, a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:\n\nNotice that this.state.value is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.\n\n# The select Tag\n\nIn HTML, \\\u003cselect\u003e creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:\n\n\\\u003cselect\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"grapefruit\"\u003eGrapefruit\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"lime\"\u003eLime\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption selected value=\"coconut\"\u003eCoconut\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"mango\"\u003eMango\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003c/select\u003e\n\nNote that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/JbbEzX?editors=0010)\n\nOverall, this makes it so that \\\u003cinput type=\"text\"\u003e, \\\u003ctextarea\u003e, and \\\u003cselect\u003e all work very similarly - they all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.\n\n\u003e NoteYou can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:\\\u003cselect multiple={true} value={\\['B', 'C']}\u003e\n\n# The file input Tag\n\nIn HTML, an \\\u003cinput type=\"file\"\u003e lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications).\n\n\\\u003cinput type=\"file\" /\u003e\n\nBecause its value is read-only, it is an **uncontrolled** component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components [later in the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#the-file-input-tag).\n\n# Handling Multiple Inputs\n\nWhen you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.\n\nFor example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/wgedvV?editors=0010)\n\nNote how we used the ES6 [computed property name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name:\n\nIt is equivalent to this ES5 code:\n\nAlso, since setState() automatically [merges a partial state into the current state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-are-merged), we only needed to call it with the changed parts.\n\n# Controlled Input Null Value\n\nSpecifying the value prop on a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you've specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.\n\nThe following code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.)\n\n# Alternatives to Controlled Components\n\nIt can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out [uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html), an alternative technique for implementing input forms.\n\n# Fully-Fledged Solutions\n\nIf you're looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state --- so don't neglect to learn them.\n\n# **Lifting State Up**\n\n# Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let's see how this works in action.\n\nIn this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature.\n\nWe will start with a component called BoilingVerdict. It accepts the celsius temperature as a prop, and prints whether it is enough to boil the water:\n\nNext, we will create a component called Calculator. It renders an \\\u003cinput\u003e that lets you enter the temperature, and keeps its value in this.state.temperature.\n\nAdditionally, it renders the BoilingVerdict for the current input value.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZXeOBm?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/zYzxZoL?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Adding a Second Input\n\nOur new requirement is that, in addition to a Celsius input, we provide a Fahrenheit input, and they are kept in sync.\n\nWe can start by extracting a TemperatureInput component from Calculator. We will add a new scale prop to it that can either be \"c\" or \"f\":\n\nWe can now change the Calculator to render two separate temperature inputs:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/jGBryx?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/QWgwpGv?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe have two inputs now, but when you enter the temperature in one of them, the other doesn't update. This contradicts our requirement: we want to keep them in sync.\n\nWe also can't display the BoilingVerdict from Calculator. The Calculator doesn't know the current temperature because it is hidden inside the TemperatureInput.\n\n# Writing Conversion Functions\n\nFirst, we will write two functions to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back:\n\nThese two functions convert numbers. We will write another function that takes a string temperature and a converter function as arguments and returns a string. We will use it to calculate the value of one input based on the other input.\n\nIt returns an empty string on an invalid temperature, and it keeps the output rounded to the third decimal place:\n\nFor example, tryConvert('abc', toCelsius) returns an empty string, and tryConvert('10.22', toFahrenheit) returns '50.396'.\n\n# Lifting State Up\n\nCurrently, both TemperatureInput components independently keep their values in the local state:\n\nHowever, we want these two inputs to be in sync with each other. When we update the Celsius input, the Fahrenheit input should reflect the converted temperature, and vice versa.\n\nIn React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called \"lifting state up\". We will remove the local state from the TemperatureInput and move it into the Calculator instead.\n\nIf the Calculator owns the shared state, it becomes the \"source of truth\" for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since the props of both TemperatureInput components are coming from the same parent Calculator component, the two inputs will always be in sync.\n\nLet's see how this works step by step.\n\nFirst, we will replace this.state.temperature with this.props.temperature in the TemperatureInput component. For now, let's pretend this.props.temperature already exists, although we will need to pass it from the Calculator in the future:\n\nWe know that [props are read-only](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only). When the temperature was in the local state, the TemperatureInput could just call this.setState() to change it. However, now that the temperature is coming from the parent as a prop, the TemperatureInput has no control over it.\n\nIn React, this is usually solved by making a component \"controlled\". Just like the DOM \\\u003cinput\u003e accepts both a value and an onChange prop, so can the custom TemperatureInput accept both temperature and onTemperatureChange props from its parent Calculator.\n\nNow, when the TemperatureInput wants to update its temperature, it calls this.props.onTemperatureChange:\n\n\u003e Note:There is no special meaning to either temperature or onTemperatureChange prop names in custom components. We could have called them anything else, like name them value and onChange which is a common convention.\n\nThe onTemperatureChange prop will be provided together with the temperature prop by the parent Calculator component. It will handle the change by modifying its own local state, thus re-rendering both inputs with the new values. We will look at the new Calculator implementation very soon.\n\nBefore diving into the changes in the Calculator, let's recap our changes to the TemperatureInput component. We have removed the local state from it, and instead of reading this.state.temperature, we now read this.props.temperature. Instead of calling this.setState() when we want to make a change, we now call this.props.onTemperatureChange(), which will be provided by the Calculator:\n\nNow let's turn to the Calculator component.\n\nWe will store the current input's temperature and scale in its local state. This is the state we \"lifted up\" from the inputs, and it will serve as the \"source of truth\" for both of them. It is the minimal representation of all the data we need to know in order to render both inputs.\n\nFor example, if we enter 37 into the Celsius input, the state of the Calculator component will be:\n\nIf we later edit the Fahrenheit field to be 212, the state of the Calculator will be:\n\nWe could have stored the value of both inputs but it turns out to be unnecessary. It is enough to store the value of the most recently changed input, and the scale that it represents. We can then infer the value of the other input based on the current temperature and scale alone.\n\nThe inputs stay in sync because their values are computed from the same state:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/WZpxpz?editors=0010)\n\nNow, no matter which input you edit, this.state.temperature and this.state.scale in the Calculator get updated. One of the inputs gets the value as is, so any user input is preserved, and the other input value is always recalculated based on it.\n\nLet's recap what happens when you edit an input:\n\n-   React calls the function specified as onChange on the DOM \\\u003cinput\u003e. In our case, this is the handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component.\n\n-   The handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component calls this.props.onTemperatureChange() with the new desired value. Its props, including onTemperatureChange, were provided by its parent component, the Calculator.\n\n-   When it previously rendered, the Calculator had specified that onTemperatureChange of the Celsius TemperatureInput is the Calculator's handleCelsiusChange method, and onTemperatureChange of the Fahrenheit TemperatureInput is the Calculator's handleFahrenheitChange method. So either of these two Calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited.\n\n-   Inside these methods, the Calculator component asks React to re-render itself by calling this.setState() with the new input value and the current scale of the input we just edited.\n\n-   React calls the Calculator component's render method to learn what the UI should look like. The values of both inputs are recomputed based on the current temperature and the active scale. The temperature conversion is performed here.\n\n-   React calls the render methods of the individual TemperatureInput components with their new props specified by the Calculator. It learns what their UI should look like.\n\n-   React calls the render method of the BoilingVerdict component, passing the temperature in Celsius as its props.\n\n-   React DOM updates the DOM with the boiling verdict and to match the desired input values. The input we just edited receives its current value, and the other input is updated to the temperature after conversion.\n\nEvery update goes through the same steps so the inputs stay in sync.\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\nThere should be a single \"source of truth\" for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the [top-down data flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#the-data-flows-down).\n\nLifting state involves writing more \"boilerplate\" code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. Since any state \"lives\" in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced. Additionally, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input.\n\nIf something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn't be in the state. For example, instead of storing both celsiusValue and fahrenheitValue, we store just the last edited temperature and its scale. The value of the other input can always be calculated from them in the render() method. This lets us clear or apply rounding to the other field without losing any precision in the user input.\n\nWhen you see something wrong in the UI, you can use [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This lets you trace the bugs to their source:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/ef94afc3447d75cdc245c77efb0d63be/react-devtools-state.gif)\n\n# **Composition vs Inheritance**\n\n# React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.\n\nIn this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.\n\n# Containment\n\nSome components don't know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic \"boxes\".\n\nWe recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output:\n\nThis lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ozqNOV?editors=0010)\n\nAnything inside the \\\u003cFancyBorder\u003e JSX tag gets passed into the FancyBorder component as a children prop. Since FancyBorder renders {props.children} inside a \\\u003cdiv\u003e, the passed elements appear in the final output.\n\nWhile this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple \"holes\" in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using children:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwZOJp?editors=0010)\n\nReact elements like \\\u003cContacts /\u003e and \\\u003cChat /\u003e are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of \"slots\" in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.\n\n# Specialization\n\nSometimes we think about components as being \"special cases\" of other components. For example, we might say that a WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog.\n\nIn React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more \"specific\" component renders a more \"generic\" one and configures it with props:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/kkEaOZ?editors=0010)\n\nComposition works equally well for components defined as classes:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwZbYa?editors=0010)\n\n# So What About Inheritance?\n\nAt Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven't found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.\n\nProps and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component's look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.\n\nIf you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.\n\n# **Thinking in React**\n\n# React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.\n\nOne of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we'll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.\n\n# Start With A Mock\n\nImagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png)\n\nOur JSON API returns some data that looks like this:\n\n# Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy\n\nThe first thing you'll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you're working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!\n\nBut how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.\n\nSince you're often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you'll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That's because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same *information architecture*. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png)\n\nYou'll see here that we have five components in our app. We've italicized the data each component represents.\n\n1.  **FilterableProductTable (orange):** contains the entirety of the example\n\n2.  **SearchBar (blue):** receives all *user input*\n\n3.  **ProductTable (green):** displays and filters the *data collection* based on *user input*\n\n4.  **ProductCategoryRow (turquoise):** displays a heading for each *category*\n\n5.  **ProductRow (red):** displays a row for each *product*\n\nIf you look at ProductTable, you'll see that the table header (containing the \"Name\" and \"Price\" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there's an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the *data collection* which is ProductTable's responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.\n\nNow that we've identified the components in our mock, let's arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:\n\n-   FilterableProductTable\n\n    -   SearchBar\n\n    -   ProductTable\n\n        -   ProductCategoryRow\n\n        -   ProductRow\n\n# Step 2: Build A Static Version in React\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 2](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/BwWzwm) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nNow that you have your component hierarchy, it's time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It's best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We'll see why.\n\nTo build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using *props*. *props* are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the concept of *state*, **don't use state at all** to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don't need it.\n\nYou can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it's usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it's easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.\n\nAt the end of this step, you'll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React's **one-way data flow** (also called *one-way binding*) keeps everything modular and fast.\n\nRefer to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/) if you need help executing this step.\n\n# A Brief Interlude: Props vs State\n\nThere are two types of \"model\" data in React: props and state. It's important to understand the distinction between the two; skim [the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) if you aren't sure what the difference is. See also [FAQ: What is the difference between state and props?](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)\n\n# Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State\n\nTo make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with **state**.\n\nTo build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is [DRY: *Don't Repeat Yourself*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you're building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don't keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.\n\nThink of all the pieces of data in our example application. We have:\n\n-   The original list of products\n\n-   The search text the user has entered\n\n-   The value of the checkbox\n\n-   The filtered list of products\n\nLet's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:\n\n1.  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.\n\n2.  Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.\n\n3.  Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.\n\nThe original list of products is passed in as props, so that's not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can't be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.\n\nSo finally, our state is:\n\n-   The search text the user has entered\n\n-   The value of the checkbox\n\n# Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 4](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/qPrNQZ) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nOK, so we've identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or *owns*, this state.\n\nRemember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. **This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,** so follow these steps to figure it out:\n\nFor each piece of state in your application:\n\n-   Identify every component that renders something based on that state.\n\n-   Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).\n\n-   Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.\n\n-   If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.\n\nLet's run through this strategy for our application:\n\n-   ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.\n\n-   The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.\n\n-   It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable\n\nCool, so we've decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable's constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.\n\nYou can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to \"ball\" and refresh your app. You'll see that the data table is updated correctly.\n\n# Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 5](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/LzWZvb) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nSo far, we've built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it's time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.\n\nReact makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.\n\nIf you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you'll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we've set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable.\n\nLet's think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.\n\n# And That's It\n\nHopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you're used to, remember that code is read far more than it's written, and it's less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you'll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)\n\n[Advanced Content](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-Content-fbe1ec3ca3544951b5763b051b843949)\n\n[React Component](https://www.notion.so/React-Component-3dc17bc49a8e4d7e89efcc1281e747d9)\n\n# Getting Startednpx create-react-app my-appcd my-appnpm startnpx create-react-app my-appnpm init react-app my-appyarn create react-app my-appnpx create-react-app my-app --template \\[template-name]npx create-react-app my-app --template typescriptnpx create-react-app my-app --use-npmmy-app├── README.md├── node_modules├── package.json├── .gitignore├── public│ ├── favicon.ico│ ├── index.html│ ├── logo192.png│ ├── logo512.png│ ├── manifest.json│ └── robots.txt└── src ├── App.css ├── App.js ├── App.test.js ├── index.css ├── index.js ├── logo.svg ├── serviceWorker.js └── setupTests.jscd my-app\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nCreate React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications.

You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.\n\nTo create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:\n\n### npx[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npx)\n\n_(_[_npx_](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)\\* comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [_instructions for older npm versions_](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))\\*\n\n### npm[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npm)\n\n_npm init \\\u003cinitializer\u003e is available in npm 6+_\n\n### Yarn[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#yarn)\n\n_yarn create is available in Yarn 0.25+_\n\n### Selecting a template[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#selecting-a-template)\n\nYou can now optionally start a new app from a template by appending --template \\[template-name] to the creation command.\n\nIf you don't select a template, we'll create your project with our base template.\n\nTemplates are always named in the format cra-template-\\[template-name], however you only need to provide the \\[template-name] to the creation command.\n\n\u003e You can find a list of available templates by searching for [\"cra-template-\\*\"](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cra-template-*) on npm.\n\nOur [Custom Templates](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates) documentation describes how you can build your own template.\n\n#### Creating a TypeScript app[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app)\n\nYou can start a new TypeScript app using templates. To use our provided TypeScript template, append --template typescript to the creation command.\n\nIf you already have a project and would like to add TypeScript, see our [Adding TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript) documentation.\n\n### Selecting a package manager[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#selecting-a-package-manager)\n\nWhen you create a new app, the CLI will use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies (when available). If you have Yarn installed, but would prefer to use npm, you can append --use-npm to the creation command. For example:\n\n## Output[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#output)\n\nRunning any of these commands will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder. Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:\n\nNo configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app. Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:\n\n## Scripts[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#scripts)\n\nInside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:\n\n### npm start or yarn start[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npm-start-or-yarn-start)\n\nRuns the app in development mode.

For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by webpack. You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside src**, otherwise webpack won’t see them.\n\nOnly files inside public can be used from public/index.html. Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\n\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories. They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\n\nIf you have Git installed and your project is not part of a larger repository, then a new repository will be initialized resulting in an additional top-level .git directory.\n\n# Developing Components in Isolationnpx -p @storybook/cli sb initnpm install --save react-styleguidistyarn add react-styleguidist \"scripts\": {+ \"styleguide\": \"styleguidist server\",+ \"styleguide:build\": \"styleguidist build\", \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",npm run styleguide\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states. For an example, a basic button component could have the following states:\n\n-   In a regular state, with a text label.\n\n-   In the disabled mode.\n\n-   In a loading state.\n\nUsually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\n\nCreate React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)\n\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\n\n## Getting Started with Storybook[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/developing-components-in-isolation#getting-started-with-storybook)\n\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\n\nRun the following command inside your app’s directory:\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Storybook:\n\n-   [Learn Storybook (tutorial)](https://learnstorybook.com/)\n\n-   [Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/)\n\n-   [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)\n\n-   [Snapshot Testing UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) with Storybook + addon/storyshot\n\n## Getting Started with Styleguidist[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/developing-components-in-isolation#getting-started-with-styleguidist)\n\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\n\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\n\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\n\nThen, add these scripts to your package.json:\n\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\n\n-   [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)\n\n-   [Documentation](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html)\n\n# Using HTTPS in Developmentset HTTPS=true\u0026\\\u0026npm start($env:HTTPS = \"true\") -and (npm start)HTTPS=true npm startHTTPS=true SSL_CRT_FILE=cert.crt SSL_KEY_FILE=cert.key npm startCopy{ \"start\": \"HTTPS=true react-scripts start\"}\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\n\u003e Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.4.0 and higher.\n\nYou may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the \"proxy\" feature](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\n\nTo do this, set the HTTPS environment variable to true, then start the dev server as usual with npm start:\n\n### Windows (cmd.exe)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#windows-cmdexe)\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n### Windows (Powershell)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#windows-powershell)\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#linux-macos-bash)\n\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\n\n## Custom SSL certificate[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#custom-ssl-certificate)\n\nTo set a custom certificate, set the SSL_CRT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE environment variables to the path of the certificate and key files in the same way you do for HTTPS above. Note that you will also need to set HTTPS=true.\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#linux-macos-bash-1)\n\nTo avoid having to set the environment variable each time, you can either include in the npm start script like so:\n\nOr you can create a .env file with HTTPS=true set. [Learn more about environment variables in CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).\n\n# Adding a Stylesheet.Button { padding: 20px;}_import_ React, { Component } _from_ 'react';_import_ './Button.css'; _// Tell webpack that Button.js uses these stylesclass_ Button _extends_ Component { render() { _// You can use them as regular CSS styles_ _return_ \\\u003cdiv className=\"Button\" /\u003e; }}\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nThis project setup uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of import beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\n\n## Button.css[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet#buttoncss)\n\n## Button.js[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet#buttonjs)\n\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-blog/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than webpack.\n\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified .css file in the build output.\n\nIf you are concerned about using webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into src/index.css. It would still be imported from src/index.js, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\n\n# Adding Images, Fonts, and Files*import* React _from_ 'react';_import_ logo _from_ './logo.png'; *// Tell webpack this JS file uses this image*console.log(logo); _// /logo.84287d09.pngfunction_ Header() { _// Import result is the URL of your image_ _return_ \\\u003cimg src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" /\u003e;}_export_ _default_ Header;.Logo { background-image: url(./logo.png);}_import_ { ReactComponent _as_ Logo } _from_ './logo.svg';_function_ App() { _return_ ( \\\u003cdiv\u003e {_/\\* Logo is an actual React component \\*/_} \\\u003cLogo /\u003e \\\u003c/div\u003e );}\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nWith webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\n\nYou can **import a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the src attribute of an image or the href of a link to a PDF.\n\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153). You can control the 10,000 byte threshold by setting the IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT environment variable as documented in our [advanced configuration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration).\n\nHere is an example:\n\nThis ensures that when the project is built, webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\n\nThis works in CSS too:\n\nwebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\n\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.\n\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).\n\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\n\n## Adding SVGs[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files#adding-svgs)\n\n\u003e Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher, and react@16.3.0 and higher.\n\nOne way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:\n\nThis is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The ReactComponent import name is significant and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.\n\n\u003e **Tip:** The imported SVG React Component accepts a title prop along with other props that a svg element accepts. Use this prop to add an accessible title to your svg component.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/seo.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/seo.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/seo.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/seo"},"title":"lorem-ipsum","subtitle":"lorem-ipsum","date":"2021-10-16","thumb_img_alt":"lorem-ipsum","excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","hide_header":false,"seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"layout":"post","markdown_content":"## Lorem ipsum\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing elit**, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n- Lorem ipsum\n- dolor sit amet"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/the-harmonic-series.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/the-harmonic-series.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/the-harmonic-series.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/the-harmonic-series"},"title":"The Harmonic Series and The Fourier Transform","subtitle":"A brief introduction","excerpt":"The City of New York, usually called either New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States.

Some musicians do not consider the fundamental to be a harmonic; it is just the fundamental. In that case, the string halves will give the first harmonic, the string thirds will give the second harmonic and so on. When the fundamental is included in calculations, it is called the first **partial**, and the rest of the harmonics are the second, third, fourth partials and so on. Also, some musicians use the term **overtones** as a synonym for harmonics. For others, however, an overtone is any frequency (not necessarily a harmonic) that can be heard resonating with the fundamental. The sound of a gong or cymbals will include overtones that aren't harmonics; that's why the gong's sound doesn't seem to have as definite a pitch as the vibrating string does. If you are uncertain what someone means by the second harmonic or by the term overtones, ask for clarification.**Vibrating String**![](https://cnx.org/resources/4c5da51d92f04c619005c9a2d674d36e27ace398/Harmseries2.png)\n\nThe fundamental pitch is produced by the whole string vibrating back and forth. But the string is also vibrating in halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, and so on, producing **harmonics**. All of these vibrations happen at the same time, producing a rich, complex, interesting sound.You will find some more extensive information on instruments and harmonics in [Standing Waves and Musical Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:07970e19-2e42-4b8e-9a7d-2749bf5d8529@4) and [Standing Waves and Wind Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d44131a-aae6-4a8b-9276-f0249bdab2fe).**Harmonic Series Wavelengths and Frequencies**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*![](https://cnx.org/resources/6e98c07a7efbb518d9a08be043a9311988da9a98/Harmseries3.png)\n\nThe second harmonic has half the wavelength and twice the frequency of the first. The third harmonic has a third the wavelength and three times the frequency of the first. The fourth harmonic has a quarter the wavelength and four times the frequency of the first, and so on. Notice that the fourth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the second harmonic, and the sixth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the third harmonic.In real music, consonance and dissonance also depend on the standard practices of a musical tradition, especially its harmony practices, but these are also often related to the harmonic series.**A Harmonic Series Written as Notes**![](https://cnx.org/resources/d7d88dada170cabb40a5168da677a7d94fdcb92d/HarmonicSeriesC.png)\n\nIf you have been looking at the harmonic series above closely, you may have noticed that some notes that are written to give the same interval have different frequency ratios. For example, the interval between the seventh and eighth harmonics is a major second, but so are the intervals between 8 and 9, between 9 and 10, and between 10 and 11. But 7:8, 8:9, 9:10, and 10:11, although they are pretty close, are not exactly the same. In fact, modern [Western](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2831cad4-20d7-4991-a977-ddb87dedcf07@8) music uses the [equal temperament](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:37a22b6b-d06d-480a-9c69-eb9daf025e38@14#s22) tuning system, which divides the octave into twelve notes that are spaced equally far apart. The positive aspect of equal temperament (and the reason it is used) is that an instrument will be equally in tune in all keys. The negative aspect is that it means that all intervals except for octaves are slightly out of tune with regard to the actual harmonic series. For more about equal temperament, see [Tuning Systems](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:37a22b6b-d06d-480a-9c69-eb9daf025e38@14#s2). Interestingly, musicians have a tendency to revert to true harmonics when they can (in other words, when it is easy to fine-tune each note). For example, an a capella choral group or a brass ensemble, may find themselves singing or playing perfect fourths and fifths, \"contracted\" major thirds and \"expanded\" minor thirds.**Bugle Calls**![](https://cnx.org/resources/b486203049c855e0c049ef8dbd7b63b77c827f07/BugleCalls.png)\n\nAlthough limited by the fact that it can only play one harmonic series, the bugle can still play many well-known tunes.Trombones use a slide instead of valves to make their instrument longer. But the basic principle is still the same. At each slide \"position\", the instrument gets a new harmonic series. The notes in between the positions aren't part of the chromatic scale, so they are usually only used for special effects like **glissandos** (sliding notes).**Overlapping Harmonic Series in Brass Instruments**![](https://cnx.org/resources/72da008accbc59a9f87e758ae9df1cca1fec2cf4/Harmseries6.png)\n\nThese harmonic series are for a brass instrument that has a \"C\" fundamental when no valves are being used - for example, a C trumpet. Remember, there is an entire harmonic series for every fundamental, and any note can be a fundamental. You just have to find the brass tube with the right length. So a trumpet or tuba can get one harmonic series using no valves, another one a half step lower using one valve, another one a whole step lower using another valve, and so on. By the time all the combinations of valves are used, there is some way to get an in-tune version of every note they need.The [French horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a) has a reputation for being a \"difficult\" instrument to play. This is also because of the harmonic series. Most brass instruments play in the first few octaves of the harmonic series, where the notes are farther apart and it takes a pretty big difference in the mouth and lips (the [embouchure](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:09ab85c2-8ecd-4b6b-99e0-3c30de50cecb#p2a), pronounced AHM-buh-sher) to get a different note. The range of the French horn is higher in the harmonic series, where the notes are closer together. So very small differences in the mouth and lips can mean the wrong harmonic comes out.**String Harmonics**![](https://cnx.org/resources/48fcee2683006bd15bb81c5f8806c034e40f7993/harmseries4a.png)\n\nHave you ever wondered how a [trumpet](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:cd9ab01b-192d-4eb9-b38f-de07fe1a3451) plays so many different notes with only three [valves](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:09ab85c2-8ecd-4b6b-99e0-3c30de50cecb#p2f), or how a bugle plays different notes with no valves at all? Have you ever wondered why an [oboe](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:763f8103-b88b-42d8-b8c4-b55c4a88a1c0) and a [flute](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:fa55c8c0-cb29-4a52-afb6-8eb514893a15) sound so different, even when they're playing the same note? What is a string player doing when she plays \"harmonics\"? Why do some notes sound good together while other notes seem to clash with each other? The answers to all of these questions will become clear with an understanding of the harmonic series.\n\n### Physics, Harmonics and Color\n\nMost musical notes are sounds that have a particular [pitch](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d74c148-7090-4235-91a5-0d9dc016e4e5@8). The pitch depends on the main [frequency](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6#fig1b) of the sound; the higher the frequency, and shorter the wavelength, of the sound waves, the higher the pitch is. But musical sounds don't have just one frequency. Sounds that have only one frequency are not very interesting or pretty. They have no more musical [color](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) than the beeping of a watch alarm. On the other hand, sounds that have too many frequencies, like the sound of glass breaking or of ocean waves crashing on a beach, may be interesting and even pleasant. But they don't have a particular pitch, so they usually aren't considered musical notes.\n\nWhen someone plays or sings a note, only a very particular set of frequencies is heard. Imagine that each note that comes out of the instrument is a smooth mixture of many different pitches. These different pitches are called **harmonics**, and they are blended together so well that you do not hear them as separate notes at all. Instead, the harmonics give the note its color.\n\nWhat is the [color](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) of a sound? Say an oboe plays a middle C. Then a flute plays the same note at the same loudness as the oboe. It is still easy to tell the two notes apart, because an oboe sounds different from a flute. This difference in the sounds is the **color**, or **timbre** (pronounced \"TAM-ber\") of the notes. Like a color you see, the color of a sound can be bright and bold or deep and rich. It can be heavy, light, murky, thin, smooth, or transparently clear. Some other words that musicians use to describe the timbre of a sound are: reedy, brassy, piercing, mellow, thin, hollow, focussed, breathy (pronounced BRETH-ee) or full. Listen to recordings of a [violin](https://cnx.org/resources/22f031c6c33fed96e9244e0eccde7824054a1f4e/timvl.mp3) and a [viola](https://cnx.org/resources/4b2cf8c5a6839a2e862483e250eea039a0d52d10/timvla.mp3). Although these instruments are quite similar, the viola has a noticeably \"deeper\" and the violin a noticeably \"brighter\" sound that is not simply a matter of the violin playing higher notes. Now listen to the same phrase played by an [electric guitar](https://cnx.org/resources/ce60ce663cccd53384dcb1bdc13845f830236b85/electricGUITARS.wav), an acoustic guitar with [twelve steel strings](https://cnx.org/resources/4e69e1ef29ca8b2fc32b3f209ba5b1a07991c643/12stringGUITARS.wav) and an acoustic guitar with [six nylon strings](https://cnx.org/resources/e91ef1b90a4eecd4ba1f909bbc63cadb5172b6ca/nylonGUITARS.wav). The words musicians use to describe timbre are somewhat subjective, but most musicians would agree with the statement that, compared with each other, the first sound is mellow, the second bright, and the third rich.\n\nListen to recordings of different instruments playing alone or playing very prominently above a group. Some suggestions: an unaccompanied violin or cello sonata, a flute, oboe, trumpet, or horn concerto, native American flute music, classical guitar, bagpipes, steel pan drums, panpipes, or organ. For each instrument, what \"color\" words would you use to describe the timbre of each instrument? Use as many words as you can that seem appropriate, and try to think of some that aren't listed above. Do any of the instruments actually make you think of specific shades of color, like fire-engine red or sky blue?\n\nWhere do the harmonics, and the timbre, come from? When a string vibrates, the main pitch you hear is from the vibration of the whole string back and forth. That is the **fundamental**, or first harmonic. But the string also vibrates in halves, in thirds, fourths, and so on. Each of these fractions also produces a harmonic. The string vibrating in halves produces the second harmonic; vibrating in thirds produces the third harmonic, and so on.\n\nA column of air vibrating inside a tube is different from a vibrating string, but the column of air can also vibrate in halves, thirds, fourths, and so on, of the fundamental, so the harmonic series will be the same. So why do different instruments have different timbres? The difference is the relative loudness of all the different harmonics compared to each other. When a [clarinet](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:bee6f6e1-8d93-4cad-8ea4-8f5bd182fa36) plays a note, perhaps the odd-numbered harmonics are strongest; when a [French horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a) plays the same notes, perhaps the fifth and tenth harmonics are the strongest. This is what you hear that allows you to recognize that it is a clarinet or horn that is playing.\n\n### The Harmonic Series\n\nA harmonic series can have any note as its fundamental, so there are many different harmonic series. But the relationship between the [frequencies](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6#fig1b) of a harmonic series is always the same. The second harmonic always has exactly half the wavelength (and twice the frequency) of the fundamental; the third harmonic always has exactly a third of the wavelength (and so three times the frequency) of the fundamental, and so on. For more discussion of wavelengths and frequencies, see [Frequency, Wavelength, and Pitch](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6).\n\nSay someone plays a note, a [middle C](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:b5ad889c-3804-480c-8ad8-56f40936fcd0@18#p2b). Now someone else plays the note that is twice the frequency of the middle C. Since this second note was already a harmonic of the first note, the sound waves of the two notes reinforce each other and sound good together. If the second person played instead the note that was just a litle bit more than twice the frequency of the first note, the harmonic series of the two notes would not fit together at all, and the two notes would not sound as good together. There are many combinations of notes that share some harmonics and make a pleasant sound together. They are considered [consonant](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:99954a89-9cad-4023-b285-93ffaac503a7@7). Other combinations share fewer or no harmonics and are considered [dissonant](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:99954a89-9cad-4023-b285-93ffaac503a7@7) or, when they really clash, simply \"out of tune\" with each other. The scales and chords of most of the world's musics are based on these physical facts.\n\nFor example, a note that is twice the frequency of another note is one [octave](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:b5ad889c-3804-480c-8ad8-56f40936fcd0@18) higher than the first note. So in the figure above, the second harmonic is one octave higher than the first; the fourth harmonic is one octave higher than the second; and the sixth harmonic is one octave higher than the third.\n\n1.  Which harmonic will be one octave higher than the fourth harmonic?\n\n2.  Predict the next four sets of octaves in a harmonic series.\n\n3.  What is the pattern that predicts which notes of a harmonic series will be one octave apart?\n\n4.  Notes one octave apart are given the same name. So if the first harmonic is a \"A\", the second and fourth will also be A's. Name three other harmonics that will also be A's.\n\nA mathematical way to say this is \"if two notes are an octave apart, the [ratio](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6e01edc4-e351-4306-a079-27319c6febc1) of their frequencies is two to one (2:1)\". Although the notes themselves can be any frequency, the 2:1 ratio is the same for all octaves. And all the other [intervals](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19) that musicians talk about can also be described as being particular ratios of frequencies.\n\nTake the third harmonic, for example. Its frequency is three times the first harmonic (ratio 3:1). Remember, the frequency of the second harmonic is two times that of the first harmonic. So the [ratio](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6e01edc4-e351-4306-a079-27319c6febc1) of the frequencies of the second to the third harmonics is 2:3. From the harmonic series shown above, you can see that the [interval](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19) between these two notes is a [perfect fifth](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19#s21). The ratio of the frequencies of all perfect fifths is 2:3.\n\n1.  The interval between the fourth and sixth harmonics (frequency ratio 4:6) is also a fifth. Can you explain this?\n\n2.  What other harmonics have an interval of a fifth?\n\n3.  Which harmonics have an interval of a fourth?\n\n4.  What is the frequency ratio for the interval of a fourth?\n\n### Brass Instruments\n\nThe harmonic series is particularly important for brass instruments. A pianist or xylophone player only gets one note from each key. A string player who wants a different note from a string holds the string tightly in a different place. This basically makes a vibrating string of a new length, with a new fundamental.\n\nBut a brass player, without changing the length of the instrument, gets different notes by actually playing the harmonics of the instrument. Woodwinds also do this, although not as much. Most woodwinds can get two different octaves with essentially the same fingering; the lower octave is the fundamental of the column of air inside the instrument at that fingering. The upper octave is the first harmonic.\n\nBut it is the brass instruments that excel in getting different notes from the same length of tubing. The sound of a brass instruments starts with vibrations of the player's lips. By vibrating the lips at different speeds, the player can cause a harmonic of the air column to sound instead of the fundamental.\n\nSo a bugle player can play any note in the harmonic series of the instrument that falls within the player's range. Compare these well-known bugle calls to the harmonic series [above](https://cnx.org/contents/KtdLe6cv@3.1:VhLlFFhd#fig2b).\n\nFor centuries, all brass instruments were valveless. A brass instrument could play only the notes of one harmonic series. The upper octaves of the series, where the notes are close together, could be difficult or impossible to play, and some of the harmonics sound quite out of tune to ears that expect equal temperament. The solution to these problems, once brass valves were perfected, was to add a few valves to the instrument. Three is usually enough. Each valve opens an extra length of tube, making the instrument a little longer, and making available a whole new harmonic series. Usually one valve gives the harmonic series one half step lower than the valveless intrument, another one whole step lower, and another one and a half steps lower. The valves can be used at the same time, too, making even more harmonic series. So a valved brass instrument can find, in the comfortable middle of its range (its **middle register**), a valve combination that will give a reasonably in-tune version for every note of the [chromatic scale](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6028dc7a-df69-4a6b-a6d3-a1ec27c417dc@16#p0bb). (For more on the history of valved brass, see [History of the French Horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a#s2). For more on how and why harmonics are produced in wind instruments, please see [Standing Waves and Wind Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d44131a-aae6-4a8b-9276-f0249bdab2fe))\n\nWrite the harmonic series for the instrument above when both the first and second valves are open. (You can use this [PDF file](https://cnx.org/resources/e5b6335c0813bd7797983b645d24962d8ad96e93/staffpaper1.pdf) if you need staff paper.) What new notes are added in the instrument's middle range? Are any notes still missing?\n\n### Playing Harmonics on Strings\n\nString players also use harmonics, although not as much as brass players. Harmonics on strings have a very different [timbre](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) from ordinary string sounds. They give a quieter, thinner, more bell-like tone, and are usually used as a kind of ear-catching-special-effect.\n\nNormally when a string player puts a finger on a string, he holds it down tight. This basically forms a (temporarily) shorter vibrating string, which then produces an entire harmonic series, with a shorter (higher) fundamental.\n\nIn order to play a harmonic, he touches the string very, very lightly instead. So the length of the string does not change. Instead, the light touch interferes with all of the vibrations that don't have a node at that spot. (A **node** is a place in the wave where the string does not move back-and-forth. For example, the ends of the string are both nodes, since they are held in place.)\n\nThe thinner, quieter sound of \"playing harmonics\" is caused by the fact that much of the harmonic series is missing from the sound, which will of course be heard in the [timbre](https://cnx.org/contents/KtdLe6cv@3.1:VhLlFFhd#p1bb). Lightly touching the string in most spots will result in no sound at all. It only works at the precise spots that will leave some of the main harmonics (the longer, louder, lower-numbered ones) free to vibrate.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/webdev-setup.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/webdev-setup.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/webdev-setup.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/webdev-setup"},"title":"Bryan Guner Blog Backup","subtitle":"Just incase I irreparably damage my main blog site!","excerpt":"Apparently, Japan is covered in magical and irresistibly cute animal sanctuaries.

With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically \"developed\" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.\n\n\u003e When you photograph people in color, you photograph their clothes. But when you photograph people in Black and white, you photograph their souls! ― Ted Grant\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

These people write the code that gets a website working and visible on the world wide web.\n\nThe primary task of a web developer is to write code, which is a set of commands and instructions written in a particular programming language. Code makes up everything in the online world, from your computer’s operating system to the backend of a website you visit.\n\nTake a look at Wikipedia’s homepage and imagine what it might take to create even such a simple website. A web developer set up the layout of this page, from the sidebar to the tables to the top bar. They had to set up scripts to take blurbs from the featured articles and request dynamic content from the site.\n\nA database stores these articles and their revisions, also set up by a developer.\n\nWikipedia homepage\n\nIt takes a ton of work, but everything comes together piece by piece to create a functional website.\n\nWith the exponential rise of the internet, programmers are in high demand and have a great job outlook. Everyone wants to have their website, and web developers are here to help them make it.\n\n[Want to work in web development... but no idea where to start? 😅 This post has the best online learning platforms, web development tools, and career info you’ll need ⬇️Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinsta.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-become-a-web-developer%2F\u0026via=kinsta\u0026text=Want+to+work+in+web+development...+but+no+idea+where+to+start%3F+%F0%9F%98%85+This+post+has+the+best+online+learning+platforms%2C+web+development+tools%2C+and+career+info+you%E2%80%99ll+need+%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F\u0026hashtags=WebDev%2CTechCareers)\n\n## What Does a Web Developer Do?\n\nWondering what exactly your daily tasks are? Here’s the general job description for a web developer:\n\n-   Use code to create websites and prototypes\n\n-   Design a visually appealing layout for a website (either from scratch or with the help of a [web designer](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/))\n\n-   Maintain active websites by [cleaning up code](https://kinsta.com/blog/code-review-tools/) and debugging errors\n\n-   Create a database [using SQL](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/)\n\n-   Work with clients to decide on project scope and figure out the fine details of website features and design\n\nThere are dozens of ways you can specialize, which will change your job description a fair bit. For instance, you could choose to work in frontend or backend technologies, or you could [become a systems administrator](https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/) responsible for keeping servers up and running.\n\nBut in general, these are the most basic tasks you’ll be responsible for.\n\n## Why Become a Web Developer?\n\nWhile it may not be for everyone, web development has a shallow barrier to entry and is one of the most accessible jobs you can pick up. Despite this, it pays reasonably well, and web developers are always in demand.\n\nThat’s not to say that the work isn’t often challenging, but the fundamentals are very quickly self-taught (and many developers like the challenge!).\n\nBreaking into the ever-growing tech industry is always a good choice long-term. If you’re willing and able to pursue [popular coding languages](https://kinsta.com/blog/scripting-languages/) — and in web development, there’s always a hot new language employers are scrambling to hire for — you’re almost guaranteed a steady job.\n\nPopular coding languages between 2020–21\n\nFinally, web development is a flexible job. Your career may be spent [doing freelance work](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-tools-for-freelancers/) or at a [company with a salary](https://kinsta.com/developer-roles/development-at-kinsta/). The tasks you do and the skills or languages you focus on are up to you.\n\nYou’ll need to try out programming before you can say if it’s right for you, but if you put in the work to try beginner coding and find that it makes sense, then you may make a good web developer.\n\n### Web Developer Salary and Demand\n\nIf you’re considering becoming a web developer, it’s good to know what sort of salary you can expect and how easy it will be to get a job.\n\nYou can check our write-ups on [the average web developer salary](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/), plus [PHP developers](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-developer-salary/) and [WordPress developers](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/).\n\nBut the consensus is that the average developer makes $60k–75k/year.\n\nAverage developer base salary in June 2021\n\nOf course, the pay will depend on your experience level, the languages and technologies you pursue, and whether you freelance or work a steady job. But it’s a reasonable estimate to start with.\n\nAs for demand, the US Bureau of Labor predicts that [demand for web designers and developers will grow 8%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6) from 2019–29. For reference, that’s double what most occupations on average are projected to grow.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor statistics on increases in employment opportunities for web developers\n\nSome web developer jobs are more competitive than others — positions like frontend developer, which are far easier to pick up, may pay less well and be more laborious to find a job for — but the outlook is still outstanding.\n\n## How Hard Is It to Become a Web Developer?\n\nWeb development is one of the most straightforward jobs to get into — if you can figure out programming. Not all jobs are for everyone, and there will be those who may struggle to wrap their heads around code.\n\nFor some people, becoming a web developer will be a breeze. For others, it may never quite click with you. But for most people, a little dedication and a lot of practice will go a long way.\n\nThe process of becoming a web developer is much less convoluted than other jobs, and there are [more paths available](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/) to get you on the right track. It’s also a much more flexible, varied job with lots of different specializations. So whatever your learning style or skills you’re suited for, there’s something for you.\n\nMastering web development will take ongoing work and dedication, and it’s a job that offers a challenge and requires problem-solving skills. It’s easy to learn the basics, but expect to encounter frustrating yet solvable problems along the way.\n\n### Web Development Requirements\n\nCurious about what you’ll need to become a web developer? The exact requirements depend on where you’re specializing. For instance, a backend developer should generally create and edit a database, but you cannot expect the same of a frontend developer.\n\nIn addition, the programming languages and frameworks you know will distinguish you as a specific type of developer.\n\nStill, here are some skills and knowledge you’ll need, regardless of specialization, before you can call yourself a web developer:\n\n-   Proficiency in at least one web language. Depending on your position, you will likely need to learn more.\n\n-   Knowledge in other related skills ([web frameworks](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/), libraries, [Git](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/), etc.).\n\n-   Problem-solving skills are required to work with and debug code.\n\n-   Attentive to details to stop bugs from happening in the first place.\n\n-   Communication and team skills are essential to work with other developers, clients, designers, and testers.\n\n-   A degree of independence and being able to problem-solve on your own.\n\n-   Self-motivated learning is another necessary skill for success.\n\n-   Familiarity with [popular web development tools](https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/) is valuable.\n\n### Do You Need a Degree to Become a Web Developer?\n\nMany jobs request that applicants have an associate’s degree in computer science or a similar field. Other positions may ask for a bachelor’s degree or just certification from an online course.\n\nHowever, you do not strictly need a college degree to get a job. Experience and a [complete portfolio](https://kinsta.com/blog/portfolio-website/) are often far more valuable. More and more job listings are skipping out on requiring a degree and opting to ask for proof of experience.\n\nAs this is a highly technical field with plenty of room for self-teaching, it’s more important that you know how to do the job than that you’re certified to do it. That said, a degree will make it simpler from the start.\n\nSelf-taught developers may find difficulty landing their first job with neither experience nor a degree. You’ll likely need to fill your portfolio with self-made projects first or turn to freelance to build up some job history.\n\nIf you don’t want a formal college degree, online certifications like those offered by coding bootcamps can be a suitable replacement.\n\n### Types of Web Developers\n\nWeb development is a highly specialized career. You’ll rarely find a person who describes themselves simply as a “web developer.” Depending on what you do, which part of the website you focus on, and what technologies you work with, you can choose from a wide array of job titles.\n\n-   **Frontend developer:** A widespread choice as the skills are easy to pick up, frontend/client-side developers work on the front-facing website. Languages of choice are [HTML](https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/), CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap and jQuery are also popular technologies.\n\n-   **Backend developer:** These developers work with technologies like the server and database. No backend developer is the same, as there are dozens of backend programming languages. Common choices are Java, Ruby, [PHP](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/), Python, and [MySQL](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/).\n\n-   **Full-stack developer:** A combination of frontend and backend developers. They know enough languages to get by on the server and client sides.\n\nThese are the main three, but you can specialize further by becoming a web engineer, security expert, [WordPress developer](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/), mobile web developer, web application developer, and more.\n\n## Steps to Becoming a Web Developer\n\nYou can take various paths to become a web developer, and your own experience will present unique challenges. But generally, most web development careers follow a similar form.\n\nFirst, you need to choose how you’ll learn development. Will you be going to college? What sort of degree are you pursuing? An associate’s or bachelor’s degree related in some way to computer science is best.\n\nIf you’re not going to college, will you try to get certified? Certification or not, will you take a paid or free online course? Or are you going all-in to teach yourself using [only online resources](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/)?\n\nAfter you’ve decided that, you’ll need to pick a specialization (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.). You can put this off as you experiment with different aspects of web development, but you need to choose before pursuing a narrowed study.\n\nNext, is what [programming languages](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/) and technologies do you want to learn?\n\nAll this may come in a different order. You may choose to specialize or go in already knowing what languages you want to learn and then select a course accordingly.\n\n### Want to know how we increased our traffic over 1000%?\n\nJoin 20,000+ others who get our weekly newsletter with insider WordPress tips!\n\n[Subscribe Now](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer/#newsletter)\n\nAfter you’ve picked up some web development skills, you’ll need to get some projects under your belt for your portfolio.

A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for both features there.\n\nHiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by [New Zealanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips), walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran and in the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, are referred to as [backpacking](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(wilderness)\u003e).\n\n## Long Distance Hiking\n\nFrequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the National Trail System in the USA and The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours are often made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of mountain huts.\n\nIn the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), trail (USA), The Grande Randonnée (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the Appalachian Trail in the USA and the Pennine Way in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury. Hiking times can be estimated by Naismith's rule or Tobler's hiking function.\n\n## Equipment\n\nThe equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of \"Ten Essentials\" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.\n\n\u003e Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. ― Cindy Ross\n\nProponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nNatural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.\n\nHuman waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.

Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.\n\n\u003e TipThis guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.\n\nThis is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.\n\nEvery chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. **You can learn most of React by reading the \"Main Concepts\" guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.** For example, [\"Introducing JSX\"](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is the next chapter after this one.\n\n# Knowledge Level Assumptions\n\nReact is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. **If you don't feel very confident, we recommend **[**going through a JavaScript tutorial**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)** to check your knowledge level** and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.\n\n\u003e NoteThis guide occasionally uses some newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should get you most of the way.\n\n# **Introducing JSX**\n\n# Consider this variable declaration:\n\nThis funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.\n\nIt is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.\n\nJSX produces React \"elements\". We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html). Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.\n\n# Why JSX?\n\nReact embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.\n\nInstead of artificially separating *technologies* by putting markup and logic in separate files, React [separates *concerns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) with loosely coupled units called \"components\" that contain both. We will come back to components in a [further section](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), but if you're not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) might convince you otherwise.\n\nReact [doesn't require](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get started!\n\n# Embedding Expressions in JSX\n\nIn the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:\n\nYou can put any valid [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.\n\nIn the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an \\\u003ch1\u003e element.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"embedding-expressions-jsx\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZgm?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZgm\"\u003e\n  embedding-expressions-jsx\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn't required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of [automatic semicolon insertion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283).\n\n# JSX is an Expression Too\n\nAfter compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.\n\nThis means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:\n\n# Specifying Attributes with JSX\n\nYou may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:\n\nYou may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:\n\nDon't put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.\n\n\u003e Warning:Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.\n\n# Specifying Children with JSX\n\nIf a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with /\u003e, like XML:\n\nJSX tags may contain children:\n\n# JSX Prevents Injection Attacks\n\nIt is safe to embed user input in JSX:\n\nBy default, React DOM [escapes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html) any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that's not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent [XSS (cross-site-scripting)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.\n\n# JSX Represents Objects\n\nBabel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.\n\nThese two examples are identical:\n\nReact.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:\n\nThese objects are called \"React elements\". You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.\n\nWe will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).\n\n\u003e Tip:We recommend using the \"Babel\" language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.\n\n# **Rendering Elements**\n\n# Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.\n\nAn element describes what you want to see on the screen:\n\nconst element = \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, world\\\u003c/h1\u003e;\n\nUnlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.\n\n\u003e Note:One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of \"components\". We will introduce components in the next section. Elements are what components are \"made of\", and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.\n\n# Rendering an Element into the DOM\n\nLet's say there is a \\\u003cdiv\u003e somewhere in your HTML file:\n\nWe call this a \"root\" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.\n\nApplications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.\n\nTo render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e):\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/render-an-element)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"rendering-elements\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWeb?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWeb\"\u003e\n  rendering-elements\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt displays \"Hello, world\" on the page.\n\n# Updating the Rendered Element\n\nReact elements are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.\n\nWith our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e).\n\nConsider this ticking clock example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"updating-rendered-elements\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvNy?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvNy\"\u003e\n  updating-rendered-elements\u003c/a\u003e by Bryan C Guner (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz\"\u003e@bgoonz\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt calls \\[ReactDOM.render()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\u003e) every second from a \\[setInterval()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval\u003e) callback.\n\n\u003e Note:In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.We recommend that you don't skip topics because they build on each other.\n\n# React Only Updates What's Necessary\n\nReact DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.\n\nYou can verify by inspecting the [last example](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element) with the browser tools:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif)\n\nEven though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.\n\nIn our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.\n\n# **Components and Props**\n\n# Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a [detailed component API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).\n\nConceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called \"props\") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.\n\n# Function and Class Components\n\nThe simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:\n\nThis function is a valid React component because it accepts a single \"props\" (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components \"function components\" because they are literally JavaScript functions.\n\nYou can also use an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to define a component:\n\nThe above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.\n\nFunction and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss in the [next sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).\n\n# Rendering a Component\n\nPreviously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:\n\nHowever, elements can also represent user-defined components:\n\nWhen React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object \"props\".\n\nFor example, this code renders \"Hello, Sara\" on the page:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/rendering-a-component)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"rendering-component\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/QWgwpjd?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nLet's recap what happens in this example:\n\n1.  We call ReactDOM.render() with the \\\u003cWelcome name=\"Sara\" /\u003e element.\n\n2.  React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.\n\n3.  Our Welcome component returns a \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, Sara\\\u003c/h1\u003e element as the result.\n\n4.  React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match \\\u003ch1\u003eHello, Sara\\\u003c/h1\u003e.\n\n\u003e Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example,\n\n# Composing Components\n\nComponents can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.\n\nFor example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/composing-components)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=\"https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/LYLEWNq?default-tab=html%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTypically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.\n\n# Extracting Components\n\nDon't be afraid to split components into smaller components.\n\nFor example, consider this Comment component:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/PojwpzP?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.\n\nThis component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let's extract a few components from it.\n\nFirst, we will extract Avatar:\n\nThe Avatar doesn't need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.\n\nWe recommend naming props from the component's own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.\n\nWe can now simplify Comment a tiny bit:\n\nNext, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user's name:\n\nfunction UserInfo(props) { return ( \\\u003cdiv className=\"UserInfo\"\u003e \\\u003cAvatar user={props.user} /\u003e \\\u003cdiv className=\"UserInfo-name\"\u003e {props.user.name} \\\u003c/div\u003e \\\u003c/div\u003e ); }\n\nThis lets us simplify Comment even further:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components-continued)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvzV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nExtracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.\n\n# Props are Read-Only\n\nWhether you declare a component [as a function or a class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:\n\nSuch functions are called [\"pure\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.\n\nIn contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:\n\nReact is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:\n\n**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**\n\nOf course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), we will introduce a new concept of \"state\". State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.\n\n# **State and Lifecycle**\n\n# This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a [detailed component API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).\n\nConsider the ticking clock example from [one of the previous sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#updating-the-rendered-element). In [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom), we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwoJZk?editors=0010)\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.\n\nWe can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/dpdoYR?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/powvegw?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nHowever, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.\n\nIdeally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:\n\nTo implement this, we need to add \"state\" to the Clock component.\n\nState is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.\n\n# Converting a Function to a Class\n\nYou can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:\n\n1.  Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), with the same name, that extends React.Component.\n\n2.  Add a single empty method to it called render().\n\n3.  Move the body of the function into the render() method.\n\n4.  Replace props with this.props in the render() body.\n\n5.  Delete the remaining empty function declaration.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/zKRGpo?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvJV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nClock is now defined as a class rather than a function.\n\nThe render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render \\\u003cClock /\u003e into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.\n\n# Adding Local State to a Class\n\nWe will move the date from props to state in three steps:\n\n1.  Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method:\n\n\u003c!----\u003e\n\n1.  Add a [class constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor) that assigns the initial this.state:\n\nNote how we pass props to the base constructor:\n\nClass components should always call the base constructor with props.\n\n1.  Remove the date prop from the \\\u003cClock /\u003e element:\n\nWe will later add the timer code back to the component itself.\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/KgQpJd?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/oNwgZbV?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nNext, we'll make the Clock set up its own timer and update itself every second.\n\n# Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class\n\nIn applications with many components, it's very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.\n\nWe want to [set up a timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called \"mounting\" in React.\n\nWe also want to [clear that timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval) whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called \"unmounting\" in React.\n\nWe can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:\n\nThese methods are called \"lifecycle methods\".\n\nThe componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:\n\nNote how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID).\n\nWhile this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn't participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).\n\nWe will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method:\n\nFinally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock component will run every second.\n\nIt will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component local state:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/amqdNA?editors=0010)\n\nNow the clock ticks every second.\n\nLet's quickly recap what's going on and the order in which the methods are called:\n\n1.  When \\\u003cClock /\u003e is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor of the Clock component. Since Clock needs to display the current time, it initializes this.state with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.\n\n2.  React then calls the Clock component's render() method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the Clock's render output.\n\n3.  When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle method. Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component's tick() method once a second.\n\n4.  Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render() method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.\n\n5.  If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.\n\n# Using State Correctly\n\nThere are three things you should know about setState().\n\n# Do Not Modify State Directly\n\nFor example, this will not re-render a component:\n\nInstead, use setState():\n\nThe only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.\n\n# State Updates May Be Asynchronous\n\nReact may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.\n\nBecause this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\nFor example, this code may fail to update the counter:\n\nTo fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:\n\nWe used an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) above, but it also works with regular functions:\n\n# State Updates are Merged\n\nWhen you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.\n\nFor example, your state may contain several independent variables:\n\nThen you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:\n\nThe merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments.\n\n# The Data Flows Down\n\nNeither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn't care whether it is defined as a function or a class.\n\nThis is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.\n\nA component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:\n\nThe FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props and wouldn't know whether it came from the Clock's state, from the Clock's props, or was typed by hand:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/zKRqNB?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/GREgWEp?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis is commonly called a \"top-down\" or \"unidirectional\" data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components \"below\" them in the tree.\n\nIf you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component's state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.\n\nTo show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three \\\u003cClock\u003es:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/vXdGmd?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/YzQPZQK?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nEach Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently.\n\nIn React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.\n\n# **Handling Events**\n\n# Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:\n\n-   React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.\n\n-   With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.\n\nFor example, the HTML:\n\nis slightly different in React:\n\nAnother difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:\n\nIn React, this could instead be:\n\nHere, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/), so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events. See the \\[SyntheticEvent]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/events.html\u003e) reference guide to learn more.\n\nWhen using React, you generally don't need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.\n\nWhen you define a component using an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/xEmzGg?editors=0010)\n\nYou have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not [bound](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.\n\nThis is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of [how functions work in JavaScript](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/understanding-javascript-function-prototype-bind/). Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.\n\nIf calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental [public class fields syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/), you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:\n\nThis syntax is enabled by default in [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).\n\nIf you aren't using class fields syntax, you can use an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) in the callback:\n\nThe problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.\n\n# Passing Arguments to Event Handlers\n\nInside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:\n\n\\\u003cbutton onClick={(e) =\u003e this.deleteRow(id, e)}\u003eDelete Row\\\u003c/button\u003e\\\u003cbutton onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}\u003eDelete Row\\\u003c/button\u003e\n\nThe above two lines are equivalent, and use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and \\[Function.prototype.bind]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind\u003e) respectively.\n\nIn both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.\n\n# **Conditional Rendering**\n\n# In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.\n\nConditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like \\[if]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else\u003e) or the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.\n\nConsider these two components:\n\nWe'll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZpVxNq?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWmJ?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop.\n\n# Element Variables\n\nYou can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn't change.\n\nConsider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons:\n\nIn the example below, we will create a [stateful component](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class) called LoginControl.\n\nIt will render either \\\u003cLoginButton /\u003e or \\\u003cLogoutButton /\u003e depending on its current state. It will also render a \\\u003cGreeting /\u003e from the previous example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/QKzAgB?editors=0010)\n\nWhile declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below.\n\n# Inline If with Logical \u0026\u0026 Operator\n\nYou may [embed expressions in JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical \u0026\u0026 operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ozJddz?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/VwWYppo?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIt works because in JavaScript, true \u0026\u0026 expression always evaluates to expression, and false \u0026\u0026 expression always evaluates to false.\n\nTherefore, if the condition is true, the element right after \u0026\u0026 will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it.\n\nNote that returning a falsy expression will still cause the element after \u0026\u0026 to be skipped but will return the falsy expression. In the example below, \\\u003cdiv\u003e0\\\u003c/div\u003e will be returned by the render method.\n\n# Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator\n\nAnother method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator \\[condition ? true : false]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\u003e).\n\nIn the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text.\n\nIt can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what's going on:\n\nJust like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).\n\n# Preventing Component from Rendering\n\nIn rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.\n\nIn the example below, the \\\u003cWarningBanner /\u003e is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/Xjoqwm?editors=0010)\n\nReturning null from a component's render method does not affect the firing of the component's lifecycle methods. For instance componentDidUpdate will still be called.\n\n# **Lists and Keys**\n\n# First, let's review how you transform lists in JavaScript.\n\nGiven the code below, we use the \\[map()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\u003e) function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:\n\nThis code logs \\[2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.\n\nIn React, transforming arrays into lists of [elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) is nearly identical.\n\n# Rendering Multiple Components\n\nYou can build collections of elements and [include them in JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) using curly braces {}.\n\nBelow, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript \\[map()]\\(\\\u003chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\u003e) function. We return a \\\u003cli\u003e element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:\n\nWe include the entire listItems array inside a \\\u003cul\u003e element, and [render it to the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom):\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/GjPyQr?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/eYRmvvr?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.\n\n# Basic List Component\n\nUsually you would render lists inside a [component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).\n\nWe can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of numbers and outputs a list of elements.\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A \"key\" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We'll discuss why it's important in the next section.\n\nLet's assign a key to our list items inside numbers.map() and fix the missing key issue.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/jrXYRR?editors=0011)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/yLXyMMP?editors=0011\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Keys\n\nKeys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:\n\nThe best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:\n\nWhen you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:\n\nWe don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny's article for an [in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318). If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.\n\nHere is an [in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children) if you're interested in learning more.\n\n# Extracting Components with Keys\n\nKeys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.\n\nFor example, if you [extract](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components) a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the \\\u003cListItem /\u003e elements in the array rather than on the \\\u003cli\u003e element in the ListItem itself.\n\n**Example: Incorrect Key Usage**\n\n**Example: Correct Key Usage**\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZXeOGM?editors=0010)\n\nA good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.\n\n# Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings\n\nKeys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don't need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/NRZYGN?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/mdwyWWy?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nKeys serve as a hint to React but they don't get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:\n\nWith the example above, the Post component can read props.id, but not props.key.\n\n# Embedding map() in JSX\n\nIn the examples above we declared a separate listItems variable and included it in JSX:\n\nJSX allows [embedding any expression](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) in curly braces so we could inline the map() result:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/BLvYrB?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/JjJoWEw?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).\n\n# **Forms**\n\n# HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:\n\nThis form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it's convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called \"controlled components\".\n\n# Controlled Components\n\nIn HTML, form elements such as \\\u003cinput\u003e, \\\u003ctextarea\u003e, and \\\u003cselect\u003e typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with \\[setState()]\\(\\\u003chttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate\u003e).\n\nWe can combine the two by making the React state be the \"single source of truth\". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a \"controlled component\".\n\nFor example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/VmmPgp?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/rNwayjv?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSince the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.\n\nWith a controlled component, the input's value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.\n\n# The textarea Tag\n\nIn HTML, a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e element defines its text by its children:\n\nIn React, a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a \\\u003ctextarea\u003e can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:\n\nNotice that this.state.value is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.\n\n# The select Tag\n\nIn HTML, \\\u003cselect\u003e creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:\n\n\\\u003cselect\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"grapefruit\"\u003eGrapefruit\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"lime\"\u003eLime\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption selected value=\"coconut\"\u003eCoconut\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003coption value=\"mango\"\u003eMango\\\u003c/option\u003e\\\u003c/select\u003e\n\nNote that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/JbbEzX?editors=0010)\n\nOverall, this makes it so that \\\u003cinput type=\"text\"\u003e, \\\u003ctextarea\u003e, and \\\u003cselect\u003e all work very similarly - they all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.\n\n\u003e NoteYou can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:\\\u003cselect multiple={true} value={\\['B', 'C']}\u003e\n\n# The file input Tag\n\nIn HTML, an \\\u003cinput type=\"file\"\u003e lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications).\n\n\\\u003cinput type=\"file\" /\u003e\n\nBecause its value is read-only, it is an **uncontrolled** component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components [later in the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#the-file-input-tag).\n\n# Handling Multiple Inputs\n\nWhen you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.\n\nFor example:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/wgedvV?editors=0010)\n\nNote how we used the ES6 [computed property name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name:\n\nIt is equivalent to this ES5 code:\n\nAlso, since setState() automatically [merges a partial state into the current state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-are-merged), we only needed to call it with the changed parts.\n\n# Controlled Input Null Value\n\nSpecifying the value prop on a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you've specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.\n\nThe following code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.)\n\n# Alternatives to Controlled Components\n\nIt can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out [uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html), an alternative technique for implementing input forms.\n\n# Fully-Fledged Solutions\n\nIf you're looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state --- so don't neglect to learn them.\n\n# **Lifting State Up**\n\n# Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let's see how this works in action.\n\nIn this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature.\n\nWe will start with a component called BoilingVerdict. It accepts the celsius temperature as a prop, and prints whether it is enough to boil the water:\n\nNext, we will create a component called Calculator. It renders an \\\u003cinput\u003e that lets you enter the temperature, and keeps its value in this.state.temperature.\n\nAdditionally, it renders the BoilingVerdict for the current input value.\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ZXeOBm?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/zYzxZoL?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Adding a Second Input\n\nOur new requirement is that, in addition to a Celsius input, we provide a Fahrenheit input, and they are kept in sync.\n\nWe can start by extracting a TemperatureInput component from Calculator. We will add a new scale prop to it that can either be \"c\" or \"f\":\n\nWe can now change the Calculator to render two separate temperature inputs:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/jGBryx?editors=0010)\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"700\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"hello\" src=https://codepen.io/bgoonz/embed/QWgwpGv?editors=0010\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe have two inputs now, but when you enter the temperature in one of them, the other doesn't update. This contradicts our requirement: we want to keep them in sync.\n\nWe also can't display the BoilingVerdict from Calculator. The Calculator doesn't know the current temperature because it is hidden inside the TemperatureInput.\n\n# Writing Conversion Functions\n\nFirst, we will write two functions to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back:\n\nThese two functions convert numbers. We will write another function that takes a string temperature and a converter function as arguments and returns a string. We will use it to calculate the value of one input based on the other input.\n\nIt returns an empty string on an invalid temperature, and it keeps the output rounded to the third decimal place:\n\nFor example, tryConvert('abc', toCelsius) returns an empty string, and tryConvert('10.22', toFahrenheit) returns '50.396'.\n\n# Lifting State Up\n\nCurrently, both TemperatureInput components independently keep their values in the local state:\n\nHowever, we want these two inputs to be in sync with each other. When we update the Celsius input, the Fahrenheit input should reflect the converted temperature, and vice versa.\n\nIn React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called \"lifting state up\". We will remove the local state from the TemperatureInput and move it into the Calculator instead.\n\nIf the Calculator owns the shared state, it becomes the \"source of truth\" for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since the props of both TemperatureInput components are coming from the same parent Calculator component, the two inputs will always be in sync.\n\nLet's see how this works step by step.\n\nFirst, we will replace this.state.temperature with this.props.temperature in the TemperatureInput component. For now, let's pretend this.props.temperature already exists, although we will need to pass it from the Calculator in the future:\n\nWe know that [props are read-only](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only). When the temperature was in the local state, the TemperatureInput could just call this.setState() to change it. However, now that the temperature is coming from the parent as a prop, the TemperatureInput has no control over it.\n\nIn React, this is usually solved by making a component \"controlled\". Just like the DOM \\\u003cinput\u003e accepts both a value and an onChange prop, so can the custom TemperatureInput accept both temperature and onTemperatureChange props from its parent Calculator.\n\nNow, when the TemperatureInput wants to update its temperature, it calls this.props.onTemperatureChange:\n\n\u003e Note:There is no special meaning to either temperature or onTemperatureChange prop names in custom components. We could have called them anything else, like name them value and onChange which is a common convention.\n\nThe onTemperatureChange prop will be provided together with the temperature prop by the parent Calculator component. It will handle the change by modifying its own local state, thus re-rendering both inputs with the new values. We will look at the new Calculator implementation very soon.\n\nBefore diving into the changes in the Calculator, let's recap our changes to the TemperatureInput component. We have removed the local state from it, and instead of reading this.state.temperature, we now read this.props.temperature. Instead of calling this.setState() when we want to make a change, we now call this.props.onTemperatureChange(), which will be provided by the Calculator:\n\nNow let's turn to the Calculator component.\n\nWe will store the current input's temperature and scale in its local state. This is the state we \"lifted up\" from the inputs, and it will serve as the \"source of truth\" for both of them. It is the minimal representation of all the data we need to know in order to render both inputs.\n\nFor example, if we enter 37 into the Celsius input, the state of the Calculator component will be:\n\nIf we later edit the Fahrenheit field to be 212, the state of the Calculator will be:\n\nWe could have stored the value of both inputs but it turns out to be unnecessary. It is enough to store the value of the most recently changed input, and the scale that it represents. We can then infer the value of the other input based on the current temperature and scale alone.\n\nThe inputs stay in sync because their values are computed from the same state:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/WZpxpz?editors=0010)\n\nNow, no matter which input you edit, this.state.temperature and this.state.scale in the Calculator get updated. One of the inputs gets the value as is, so any user input is preserved, and the other input value is always recalculated based on it.\n\nLet's recap what happens when you edit an input:\n\n-   React calls the function specified as onChange on the DOM \\\u003cinput\u003e. In our case, this is the handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component.\n\n-   The handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component calls this.props.onTemperatureChange() with the new desired value. Its props, including onTemperatureChange, were provided by its parent component, the Calculator.\n\n-   When it previously rendered, the Calculator had specified that onTemperatureChange of the Celsius TemperatureInput is the Calculator's handleCelsiusChange method, and onTemperatureChange of the Fahrenheit TemperatureInput is the Calculator's handleFahrenheitChange method. So either of these two Calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited.\n\n-   Inside these methods, the Calculator component asks React to re-render itself by calling this.setState() with the new input value and the current scale of the input we just edited.\n\n-   React calls the Calculator component's render method to learn what the UI should look like. The values of both inputs are recomputed based on the current temperature and the active scale. The temperature conversion is performed here.\n\n-   React calls the render methods of the individual TemperatureInput components with their new props specified by the Calculator. It learns what their UI should look like.\n\n-   React calls the render method of the BoilingVerdict component, passing the temperature in Celsius as its props.\n\n-   React DOM updates the DOM with the boiling verdict and to match the desired input values. The input we just edited receives its current value, and the other input is updated to the temperature after conversion.\n\nEvery update goes through the same steps so the inputs stay in sync.\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\nThere should be a single \"source of truth\" for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the [top-down data flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#the-data-flows-down).\n\nLifting state involves writing more \"boilerplate\" code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. Since any state \"lives\" in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced. Additionally, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input.\n\nIf something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn't be in the state. For example, instead of storing both celsiusValue and fahrenheitValue, we store just the last edited temperature and its scale. The value of the other input can always be calculated from them in the render() method. This lets us clear or apply rounding to the other field without losing any precision in the user input.\n\nWhen you see something wrong in the UI, you can use [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This lets you trace the bugs to their source:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/ef94afc3447d75cdc245c77efb0d63be/react-devtools-state.gif)\n\n# **Composition vs Inheritance**\n\n# React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.\n\nIn this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.\n\n# Containment\n\nSome components don't know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic \"boxes\".\n\nWe recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output:\n\nThis lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/ozqNOV?editors=0010)\n\nAnything inside the \\\u003cFancyBorder\u003e JSX tag gets passed into the FancyBorder component as a children prop. Since FancyBorder renders {props.children} inside a \\\u003cdiv\u003e, the passed elements appear in the final output.\n\nWhile this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple \"holes\" in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using children:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwZOJp?editors=0010)\n\nReact elements like \\\u003cContacts /\u003e and \\\u003cChat /\u003e are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of \"slots\" in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.\n\n# Specialization\n\nSometimes we think about components as being \"special cases\" of other components. For example, we might say that a WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog.\n\nIn React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more \"specific\" component renders a more \"generic\" one and configures it with props:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/kkEaOZ?editors=0010)\n\nComposition works equally well for components defined as classes:\n\n[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/gwZbYa?editors=0010)\n\n# So What About Inheritance?\n\nAt Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven't found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.\n\nProps and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component's look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.\n\nIf you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.\n\n# **Thinking in React**\n\n# React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.\n\nOne of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we'll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.\n\n# Start With A Mock\n\nImagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png)\n\nOur JSON API returns some data that looks like this:\n\n# Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy\n\nThe first thing you'll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you're working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!\n\nBut how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.\n\nSince you're often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you'll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That's because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same *information architecture*. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.\n\n![](https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png)\n\nYou'll see here that we have five components in our app. We've italicized the data each component represents.\n\n1.  **FilterableProductTable (orange):** contains the entirety of the example\n\n2.  **SearchBar (blue):** receives all *user input*\n\n3.  **ProductTable (green):** displays and filters the *data collection* based on *user input*\n\n4.  **ProductCategoryRow (turquoise):** displays a heading for each *category*\n\n5.  **ProductRow (red):** displays a row for each *product*\n\nIf you look at ProductTable, you'll see that the table header (containing the \"Name\" and \"Price\" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there's an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the *data collection* which is ProductTable's responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.\n\nNow that we've identified the components in our mock, let's arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:\n\n-   FilterableProductTable\n\n    -   SearchBar\n\n    -   ProductTable\n\n        -   ProductCategoryRow\n\n        -   ProductRow\n\n# Step 2: Build A Static Version in React\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 2](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/BwWzwm) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nNow that you have your component hierarchy, it's time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It's best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We'll see why.\n\nTo build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using *props*. *props* are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the concept of *state*, **don't use state at all** to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don't need it.\n\nYou can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it's usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it's easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.\n\nAt the end of this step, you'll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React's **one-way data flow** (also called *one-way binding*) keeps everything modular and fast.\n\nRefer to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/) if you need help executing this step.\n\n# A Brief Interlude: Props vs State\n\nThere are two types of \"model\" data in React: props and state. It's important to understand the distinction between the two; skim [the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) if you aren't sure what the difference is. See also [FAQ: What is the difference between state and props?](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)\n\n# Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State\n\nTo make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with **state**.\n\nTo build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is [DRY: *Don't Repeat Yourself*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you're building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don't keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.\n\nThink of all the pieces of data in our example application. We have:\n\n-   The original list of products\n\n-   The search text the user has entered\n\n-   The value of the checkbox\n\n-   The filtered list of products\n\nLet's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:\n\n1.  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.\n\n2.  Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.\n\n3.  Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.\n\nThe original list of products is passed in as props, so that's not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can't be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.\n\nSo finally, our state is:\n\n-   The search text the user has entered\n\n-   The value of the checkbox\n\n# Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 4](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/qPrNQZ) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nOK, so we've identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or *owns*, this state.\n\nRemember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. **This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,** so follow these steps to figure it out:\n\nFor each piece of state in your application:\n\n-   Identify every component that renders something based on that state.\n\n-   Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).\n\n-   Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.\n\n-   If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.\n\nLet's run through this strategy for our application:\n\n-   ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.\n\n-   The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.\n\n-   It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable\n\nCool, so we've decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable's constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.\n\nYou can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to \"ball\" and refresh your app. You'll see that the data table is updated correctly.\n\n# Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow\n\nSee the Pen [Thinking In React: Step 5](https://codepen.io/gaearon/embed/LzWZvb) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\n\nSo far, we've built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it's time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.\n\nReact makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.\n\nIf you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you'll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we've set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable.\n\nLet's think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.\n\n# And That's It\n\nHopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you're used to, remember that code is read far more than it's written, and it's less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you'll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)\n\n[Advanced Content](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-Content-fbe1ec3ca3544951b5763b051b843949)\n\n[React Component](https://www.notion.so/React-Component-3dc17bc49a8e4d7e89efcc1281e747d9)\n\n# Getting Startednpx create-react-app my-appcd my-appnpm startnpx create-react-app my-appnpm init react-app my-appyarn create react-app my-appnpx create-react-app my-app --template \\[template-name]npx create-react-app my-app --template typescriptnpx create-react-app my-app --use-npmmy-app├── README.md├── node_modules├── package.json├── .gitignore├── public│ ├── favicon.ico│ ├── index.html│ ├── logo192.png│ ├── logo512.png│ ├── manifest.json│ └── robots.txt└── src ├── App.css ├── App.js ├── App.test.js ├── index.css ├── index.js ├── logo.svg ├── serviceWorker.js └── setupTests.jscd my-app\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nCreate React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications.

One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the \"proxy\" feature](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\n\nTo do this, set the HTTPS environment variable to true, then start the dev server as usual with npm start:\n\n### Windows (cmd.exe)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#windows-cmdexe)\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n### Windows (Powershell)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#windows-powershell)\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#linux-macos-bash)\n\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\n\n## Custom SSL certificate[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#custom-ssl-certificate)\n\nTo set a custom certificate, set the SSL_CRT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE environment variables to the path of the certificate and key files in the same way you do for HTTPS above. Note that you will also need to set HTTPS=true.\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development#linux-macos-bash-1)\n\nTo avoid having to set the environment variable each time, you can either include in the npm start script like so:\n\nOr you can create a .env file with HTTPS=true set. [Learn more about environment variables in CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).\n\n# Adding a Stylesheet.Button { padding: 20px;}_import_ React, { Component } _from_ 'react';_import_ './Button.css'; _// Tell webpack that Button.js uses these stylesclass_ Button _extends_ Component { render() { _// You can use them as regular CSS styles_ _return_ \\\u003cdiv className=\"Button\" /\u003e; }}\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nThis project setup uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of import beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\n\n## Button.css[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet#buttoncss)\n\n## Button.js[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet#buttonjs)\n\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-blog/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than webpack.\n\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified .css file in the build output.\n\nIf you are concerned about using webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into src/index.css. It would still be imported from src/index.js, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\n\n# Adding Images, Fonts, and Files*import* React _from_ 'react';_import_ logo _from_ './logo.png'; *// Tell webpack this JS file uses this image*console.log(logo); _// /logo.84287d09.pngfunction_ Header() { _// Import result is the URL of your image_ _return_ \\\u003cimg src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" /\u003e;}_export_ _default_ Header;.Logo { background-image: url(./logo.png);}_import_ { ReactComponent _as_ Logo } _from_ './logo.svg';_function_ App() { _return_ ( \\\u003cdiv\u003e {_/\\* Logo is an actual React component \\*/_} \\\u003cLogo /\u003e \\\u003c/div\u003e );}\u0026#xA;\u0026#xA;\n\nWith webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\n\nYou can **import a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the src attribute of an image or the href of a link to a PDF.\n\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153). You can control the 10,000 byte threshold by setting the IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT environment variable as documented in our [advanced configuration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration).\n\nHere is an example:\n\nThis ensures that when the project is built, webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\n\nThis works in CSS too:\n\nwebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\n\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.\n\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).\n\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\n\n## Adding SVGs[#](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files#adding-svgs)\n\n\u003e Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher, and react@16.3.0 and higher.\n\nOne way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:\n\nThis is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The ReactComponent import name is significant and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.\n\n\u003e **Tip:** The imported SVG React Component accepts a title prop along with other props that a svg element accepts. Use this prop to add an accessible title to your svg component.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/seo.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/seo.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/seo.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/seo"},"title":"lorem-ipsum","subtitle":"lorem-ipsum","date":"2021-10-16","thumb_img_alt":"lorem-ipsum","excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","hide_header":false,"seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"layout":"post","markdown_content":"## Lorem ipsum\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, **consectetur adipiscing elit**, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n- Lorem ipsum\n- dolor sit amet"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/the-harmonic-series.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/the-harmonic-series.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/the-harmonic-series.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/the-harmonic-series"},"title":"The Harmonic Series and The Fourier Transform","subtitle":"A brief introduction","excerpt":"The City of New York, usually called either New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States.

Some musicians do not consider the fundamental to be a harmonic; it is just the fundamental. In that case, the string halves will give the first harmonic, the string thirds will give the second harmonic and so on. When the fundamental is included in calculations, it is called the first **partial**, and the rest of the harmonics are the second, third, fourth partials and so on. Also, some musicians use the term **overtones** as a synonym for harmonics. For others, however, an overtone is any frequency (not necessarily a harmonic) that can be heard resonating with the fundamental. The sound of a gong or cymbals will include overtones that aren't harmonics; that's why the gong's sound doesn't seem to have as definite a pitch as the vibrating string does. If you are uncertain what someone means by the second harmonic or by the term overtones, ask for clarification.**Vibrating String**![](https://cnx.org/resources/4c5da51d92f04c619005c9a2d674d36e27ace398/Harmseries2.png)\n\nThe fundamental pitch is produced by the whole string vibrating back and forth. But the string is also vibrating in halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, and so on, producing **harmonics**. All of these vibrations happen at the same time, producing a rich, complex, interesting sound.You will find some more extensive information on instruments and harmonics in [Standing Waves and Musical Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:07970e19-2e42-4b8e-9a7d-2749bf5d8529@4) and [Standing Waves and Wind Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d44131a-aae6-4a8b-9276-f0249bdab2fe).**Harmonic Series Wavelengths and Frequencies**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*![](https://cnx.org/resources/6e98c07a7efbb518d9a08be043a9311988da9a98/Harmseries3.png)\n\nThe second harmonic has half the wavelength and twice the frequency of the first. The third harmonic has a third the wavelength and three times the frequency of the first. The fourth harmonic has a quarter the wavelength and four times the frequency of the first, and so on. Notice that the fourth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the second harmonic, and the sixth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the third harmonic.In real music, consonance and dissonance also depend on the standard practices of a musical tradition, especially its harmony practices, but these are also often related to the harmonic series.**A Harmonic Series Written as Notes**![](https://cnx.org/resources/d7d88dada170cabb40a5168da677a7d94fdcb92d/HarmonicSeriesC.png)\n\nIf you have been looking at the harmonic series above closely, you may have noticed that some notes that are written to give the same interval have different frequency ratios. For example, the interval between the seventh and eighth harmonics is a major second, but so are the intervals between 8 and 9, between 9 and 10, and between 10 and 11. But 7:8, 8:9, 9:10, and 10:11, although they are pretty close, are not exactly the same. In fact, modern [Western](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2831cad4-20d7-4991-a977-ddb87dedcf07@8) music uses the [equal temperament](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:37a22b6b-d06d-480a-9c69-eb9daf025e38@14#s22) tuning system, which divides the octave into twelve notes that are spaced equally far apart. The positive aspect of equal temperament (and the reason it is used) is that an instrument will be equally in tune in all keys. The negative aspect is that it means that all intervals except for octaves are slightly out of tune with regard to the actual harmonic series. For more about equal temperament, see [Tuning Systems](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:37a22b6b-d06d-480a-9c69-eb9daf025e38@14#s2). Interestingly, musicians have a tendency to revert to true harmonics when they can (in other words, when it is easy to fine-tune each note). For example, an a capella choral group or a brass ensemble, may find themselves singing or playing perfect fourths and fifths, \"contracted\" major thirds and \"expanded\" minor thirds.**Bugle Calls**![](https://cnx.org/resources/b486203049c855e0c049ef8dbd7b63b77c827f07/BugleCalls.png)\n\nAlthough limited by the fact that it can only play one harmonic series, the bugle can still play many well-known tunes.Trombones use a slide instead of valves to make their instrument longer. But the basic principle is still the same. At each slide \"position\", the instrument gets a new harmonic series. The notes in between the positions aren't part of the chromatic scale, so they are usually only used for special effects like **glissandos** (sliding notes).**Overlapping Harmonic Series in Brass Instruments**![](https://cnx.org/resources/72da008accbc59a9f87e758ae9df1cca1fec2cf4/Harmseries6.png)\n\nThese harmonic series are for a brass instrument that has a \"C\" fundamental when no valves are being used - for example, a C trumpet. Remember, there is an entire harmonic series for every fundamental, and any note can be a fundamental. You just have to find the brass tube with the right length. So a trumpet or tuba can get one harmonic series using no valves, another one a half step lower using one valve, another one a whole step lower using another valve, and so on. By the time all the combinations of valves are used, there is some way to get an in-tune version of every note they need.The [French horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a) has a reputation for being a \"difficult\" instrument to play. This is also because of the harmonic series. Most brass instruments play in the first few octaves of the harmonic series, where the notes are farther apart and it takes a pretty big difference in the mouth and lips (the [embouchure](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:09ab85c2-8ecd-4b6b-99e0-3c30de50cecb#p2a), pronounced AHM-buh-sher) to get a different note. The range of the French horn is higher in the harmonic series, where the notes are closer together. So very small differences in the mouth and lips can mean the wrong harmonic comes out.**String Harmonics**![](https://cnx.org/resources/48fcee2683006bd15bb81c5f8806c034e40f7993/harmseries4a.png)\n\nHave you ever wondered how a [trumpet](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:cd9ab01b-192d-4eb9-b38f-de07fe1a3451) plays so many different notes with only three [valves](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:09ab85c2-8ecd-4b6b-99e0-3c30de50cecb#p2f), or how a bugle plays different notes with no valves at all? Have you ever wondered why an [oboe](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:763f8103-b88b-42d8-b8c4-b55c4a88a1c0) and a [flute](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:fa55c8c0-cb29-4a52-afb6-8eb514893a15) sound so different, even when they're playing the same note? What is a string player doing when she plays \"harmonics\"? Why do some notes sound good together while other notes seem to clash with each other? The answers to all of these questions will become clear with an understanding of the harmonic series.\n\n### Physics, Harmonics and Color\n\nMost musical notes are sounds that have a particular [pitch](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d74c148-7090-4235-91a5-0d9dc016e4e5@8). The pitch depends on the main [frequency](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6#fig1b) of the sound; the higher the frequency, and shorter the wavelength, of the sound waves, the higher the pitch is. But musical sounds don't have just one frequency. Sounds that have only one frequency are not very interesting or pretty. They have no more musical [color](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) than the beeping of a watch alarm. On the other hand, sounds that have too many frequencies, like the sound of glass breaking or of ocean waves crashing on a beach, may be interesting and even pleasant. But they don't have a particular pitch, so they usually aren't considered musical notes.\n\nWhen someone plays or sings a note, only a very particular set of frequencies is heard. Imagine that each note that comes out of the instrument is a smooth mixture of many different pitches. These different pitches are called **harmonics**, and they are blended together so well that you do not hear them as separate notes at all. Instead, the harmonics give the note its color.\n\nWhat is the [color](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) of a sound? Say an oboe plays a middle C. Then a flute plays the same note at the same loudness as the oboe. It is still easy to tell the two notes apart, because an oboe sounds different from a flute. This difference in the sounds is the **color**, or **timbre** (pronounced \"TAM-ber\") of the notes. Like a color you see, the color of a sound can be bright and bold or deep and rich. It can be heavy, light, murky, thin, smooth, or transparently clear. Some other words that musicians use to describe the timbre of a sound are: reedy, brassy, piercing, mellow, thin, hollow, focussed, breathy (pronounced BRETH-ee) or full. Listen to recordings of a [violin](https://cnx.org/resources/22f031c6c33fed96e9244e0eccde7824054a1f4e/timvl.mp3) and a [viola](https://cnx.org/resources/4b2cf8c5a6839a2e862483e250eea039a0d52d10/timvla.mp3). Although these instruments are quite similar, the viola has a noticeably \"deeper\" and the violin a noticeably \"brighter\" sound that is not simply a matter of the violin playing higher notes. Now listen to the same phrase played by an [electric guitar](https://cnx.org/resources/ce60ce663cccd53384dcb1bdc13845f830236b85/electricGUITARS.wav), an acoustic guitar with [twelve steel strings](https://cnx.org/resources/4e69e1ef29ca8b2fc32b3f209ba5b1a07991c643/12stringGUITARS.wav) and an acoustic guitar with [six nylon strings](https://cnx.org/resources/e91ef1b90a4eecd4ba1f909bbc63cadb5172b6ca/nylonGUITARS.wav). The words musicians use to describe timbre are somewhat subjective, but most musicians would agree with the statement that, compared with each other, the first sound is mellow, the second bright, and the third rich.\n\nListen to recordings of different instruments playing alone or playing very prominently above a group. Some suggestions: an unaccompanied violin or cello sonata, a flute, oboe, trumpet, or horn concerto, native American flute music, classical guitar, bagpipes, steel pan drums, panpipes, or organ. For each instrument, what \"color\" words would you use to describe the timbre of each instrument? Use as many words as you can that seem appropriate, and try to think of some that aren't listed above. Do any of the instruments actually make you think of specific shades of color, like fire-engine red or sky blue?\n\nWhere do the harmonics, and the timbre, come from? When a string vibrates, the main pitch you hear is from the vibration of the whole string back and forth. That is the **fundamental**, or first harmonic. But the string also vibrates in halves, in thirds, fourths, and so on. Each of these fractions also produces a harmonic. The string vibrating in halves produces the second harmonic; vibrating in thirds produces the third harmonic, and so on.\n\nA column of air vibrating inside a tube is different from a vibrating string, but the column of air can also vibrate in halves, thirds, fourths, and so on, of the fundamental, so the harmonic series will be the same. So why do different instruments have different timbres? The difference is the relative loudness of all the different harmonics compared to each other. When a [clarinet](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:bee6f6e1-8d93-4cad-8ea4-8f5bd182fa36) plays a note, perhaps the odd-numbered harmonics are strongest; when a [French horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a) plays the same notes, perhaps the fifth and tenth harmonics are the strongest. This is what you hear that allows you to recognize that it is a clarinet or horn that is playing.\n\n### The Harmonic Series\n\nA harmonic series can have any note as its fundamental, so there are many different harmonic series. But the relationship between the [frequencies](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6#fig1b) of a harmonic series is always the same. The second harmonic always has exactly half the wavelength (and twice the frequency) of the fundamental; the third harmonic always has exactly a third of the wavelength (and so three times the frequency) of the fundamental, and so on. For more discussion of wavelengths and frequencies, see [Frequency, Wavelength, and Pitch](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:043f7ec4-d519-44b5-b5f2-50d380ceaab6).\n\nSay someone plays a note, a [middle C](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:b5ad889c-3804-480c-8ad8-56f40936fcd0@18#p2b). Now someone else plays the note that is twice the frequency of the middle C. Since this second note was already a harmonic of the first note, the sound waves of the two notes reinforce each other and sound good together. If the second person played instead the note that was just a litle bit more than twice the frequency of the first note, the harmonic series of the two notes would not fit together at all, and the two notes would not sound as good together. There are many combinations of notes that share some harmonics and make a pleasant sound together. They are considered [consonant](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:99954a89-9cad-4023-b285-93ffaac503a7@7). Other combinations share fewer or no harmonics and are considered [dissonant](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:99954a89-9cad-4023-b285-93ffaac503a7@7) or, when they really clash, simply \"out of tune\" with each other. The scales and chords of most of the world's musics are based on these physical facts.\n\nFor example, a note that is twice the frequency of another note is one [octave](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:b5ad889c-3804-480c-8ad8-56f40936fcd0@18) higher than the first note. So in the figure above, the second harmonic is one octave higher than the first; the fourth harmonic is one octave higher than the second; and the sixth harmonic is one octave higher than the third.\n\n1.  Which harmonic will be one octave higher than the fourth harmonic?\n\n2.  Predict the next four sets of octaves in a harmonic series.\n\n3.  What is the pattern that predicts which notes of a harmonic series will be one octave apart?\n\n4.  Notes one octave apart are given the same name. So if the first harmonic is a \"A\", the second and fourth will also be A's. Name three other harmonics that will also be A's.\n\nA mathematical way to say this is \"if two notes are an octave apart, the [ratio](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6e01edc4-e351-4306-a079-27319c6febc1) of their frequencies is two to one (2:1)\". Although the notes themselves can be any frequency, the 2:1 ratio is the same for all octaves. And all the other [intervals](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19) that musicians talk about can also be described as being particular ratios of frequencies.\n\nTake the third harmonic, for example. Its frequency is three times the first harmonic (ratio 3:1). Remember, the frequency of the second harmonic is two times that of the first harmonic. So the [ratio](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6e01edc4-e351-4306-a079-27319c6febc1) of the frequencies of the second to the third harmonics is 2:3. From the harmonic series shown above, you can see that the [interval](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19) between these two notes is a [perfect fifth](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:c5636c43-9682-40a7-9bde-d26f89e35df1@19#s21). The ratio of the frequencies of all perfect fifths is 2:3.\n\n1.  The interval between the fourth and sixth harmonics (frequency ratio 4:6) is also a fifth. Can you explain this?\n\n2.  What other harmonics have an interval of a fifth?\n\n3.  Which harmonics have an interval of a fourth?\n\n4.  What is the frequency ratio for the interval of a fourth?\n\n### Brass Instruments\n\nThe harmonic series is particularly important for brass instruments. A pianist or xylophone player only gets one note from each key. A string player who wants a different note from a string holds the string tightly in a different place. This basically makes a vibrating string of a new length, with a new fundamental.\n\nBut a brass player, without changing the length of the instrument, gets different notes by actually playing the harmonics of the instrument. Woodwinds also do this, although not as much. Most woodwinds can get two different octaves with essentially the same fingering; the lower octave is the fundamental of the column of air inside the instrument at that fingering. The upper octave is the first harmonic.\n\nBut it is the brass instruments that excel in getting different notes from the same length of tubing. The sound of a brass instruments starts with vibrations of the player's lips. By vibrating the lips at different speeds, the player can cause a harmonic of the air column to sound instead of the fundamental.\n\nSo a bugle player can play any note in the harmonic series of the instrument that falls within the player's range. Compare these well-known bugle calls to the harmonic series [above](https://cnx.org/contents/KtdLe6cv@3.1:VhLlFFhd#fig2b).\n\nFor centuries, all brass instruments were valveless. A brass instrument could play only the notes of one harmonic series. The upper octaves of the series, where the notes are close together, could be difficult or impossible to play, and some of the harmonics sound quite out of tune to ears that expect equal temperament. The solution to these problems, once brass valves were perfected, was to add a few valves to the instrument. Three is usually enough. Each valve opens an extra length of tube, making the instrument a little longer, and making available a whole new harmonic series. Usually one valve gives the harmonic series one half step lower than the valveless intrument, another one whole step lower, and another one and a half steps lower. The valves can be used at the same time, too, making even more harmonic series. So a valved brass instrument can find, in the comfortable middle of its range (its **middle register**), a valve combination that will give a reasonably in-tune version for every note of the [chromatic scale](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6028dc7a-df69-4a6b-a6d3-a1ec27c417dc@16#p0bb). (For more on the history of valved brass, see [History of the French Horn](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:2b0912e4-8a23-4475-872a-1822abf4dc9a#s2). For more on how and why harmonics are produced in wind instruments, please see [Standing Waves and Wind Instruments](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:6d44131a-aae6-4a8b-9276-f0249bdab2fe))\n\nWrite the harmonic series for the instrument above when both the first and second valves are open. (You can use this [PDF file](https://cnx.org/resources/e5b6335c0813bd7797983b645d24962d8ad96e93/staffpaper1.pdf) if you need staff paper.) What new notes are added in the instrument's middle range? Are any notes still missing?\n\n### Playing Harmonics on Strings\n\nString players also use harmonics, although not as much as brass players. Harmonics on strings have a very different [timbre](https://cnx.org/contents/2ad74b7b-a72f-42a9-a31b-7e75542e54bd@3.1:f306fb29-f034-4a34-99d5-a44adf8ae813@7) from ordinary string sounds. They give a quieter, thinner, more bell-like tone, and are usually used as a kind of ear-catching-special-effect.\n\nNormally when a string player puts a finger on a string, he holds it down tight. This basically forms a (temporarily) shorter vibrating string, which then produces an entire harmonic series, with a shorter (higher) fundamental.\n\nIn order to play a harmonic, he touches the string very, very lightly instead. So the length of the string does not change. Instead, the light touch interferes with all of the vibrations that don't have a node at that spot. (A **node** is a place in the wave where the string does not move back-and-forth. For example, the ends of the string are both nodes, since they are held in place.)\n\nThe thinner, quieter sound of \"playing harmonics\" is caused by the fact that much of the harmonic series is missing from the sound, which will of course be heard in the [timbre](https://cnx.org/contents/KtdLe6cv@3.1:VhLlFFhd#p1bb). Lightly touching the string in most spots will result in no sound at all. It only works at the precise spots that will leave some of the main harmonics (the longer, louder, lower-numbered ones) free to vibrate.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/posts/webdev-setup.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"posts/webdev-setup.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/posts/webdev-setup.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"post","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/posts/webdev-setup"},"title":"Bryan Guner Blog Backup","subtitle":"Just incase I irreparably damage my main blog site!","excerpt":"Apparently, Japan is covered in magical and irresistibly cute animal sanctuaries.
